Antonucci continued working for PDM for nine months after this incident, and Gacy made no further attempts to assault him.\nOn July 26, 1976, Gacy picked up 18-year-old hitchhiker David Cram and offered him a job with PDM; he began work the same evening. On August 21, Cram moved into Gacy's house. The next day, Cram and Gacy had several drinks to celebrate his 19th birthday, with Gacy dressed as Pogo. Gacy tricked Cram into donning handcuffs, his wrists cuffed in front of his body rather than behind. He swung Cram around while holding the chain linking the cuffs, then said he intended to rape him. Cram kicked Gacy in the face and freed himself.\nA month later, Gacy appeared at Cram's bedroom door intending to rape him, saying, \"Dave, you really don't know who I am. Maybe it would be good if you give me what I want.\" Cram resisted, straddling Gacy, who left the bedroom, stating, \"You ain't no fun.\" Cram moved out on October 5 and left PDM (although he periodically worked for Gacy over the following two years). Shortly afterwards, another employee, 18-year-old Michael Rossi, moved in. Rossi had worked for PDM since May 23, 1976. He lived with Gacy until April 1977. Rossi sometimes assisted Gacy in clowning at grand openings of businesses: Gacy as Pogo and Rossi as Patches.",

Your goal is to extract individual, verifiable claims from this text as atomic statements.\n\n**Instructions:**\n1. **Each statement must be self-contained**: Understandable without referring back to the original text.\n2. **Preserve markdown links**: If entities are linked using [Entity Name](/wiki/Entity_Name) format, maintain these links exactly as they appear in the source.\n3. **One claim per statement**: Each output statement should contain only one verifiable fact.\n4. **Avoid editorializing**: Do not add interpretation, opinion, or extra explanation beyond what is directly stated in the text.\n5. **Maintain factual integrity**: Ensure all extracted statements reflect information explicitly present in the chunk.\n\n**Example Input:**\nChunk Text:\n\"Albert Einstein was born in Ulm, in the Kingdom of Württemberg in the German Empire, on 14 March 1879.\"\n\nSection Context:\n\"Albert Einstein > Early life\"\n\n**Expected Output:**\n- \"[Albert Einstein](/wiki/Albert_Einstein) was born in [Ulm](/wiki/Ulm).\"\n- \"[Albert Einstein](/wiki/Albert_Einstein) was born on 14 March 1879.\"\n- \"[Ulm](/wiki/Ulm) was in the [Kingdom of Württemberg](/wiki/Kingdom_of_Württemberg).\"\n\n**Processing Notes:**\n- If no markdown links are present, do not add any.\n- Statements should be logically independent and concise.\n- Handle multi-sentence input by identifying each distinct claim.",
