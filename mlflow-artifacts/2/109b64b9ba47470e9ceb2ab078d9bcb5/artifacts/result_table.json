In 1999, Gandhi was named \"Asian of the century\" by Asiaweek. In a 2000 BBC poll, he was voted as the greatest man of the millennium.\nThe word Mahatma, while often mistaken for Gandhi's given name in the West, is taken from the Sanskrit words maha (meaning Great) and atma (meaning Soul). He was publicly bestowed with the honorific title \"Mahatma\" in July 1914 at farewell meeting in Town Hall, Durban. Rabindranath Tagore is said to have accorded the title to Gandhi by 1915. In his autobiography, Gandhi nevertheless explains that he never valued the title, and was often pained by it.\n\nInnumerable streets, roads, and localities in India are named after Gandhi. These include M.G. Road (the main street of a number of Indian cities including Mumbai, Bangalore, Kolkata, Lucknow, Kanpur, Gangtok and Indore), Gandhi Market (near Sion, Mumbai) and Gandhinagar (the capital of the state of Gujarat, Gandhi's birthplace).\nAs of 2008, over 150 countries have released stamps on Gandhi.

His attempts to coerce Chief Charlo to sign the agreement nearly brought about a military clash. In the end, he convinced two subchiefs to sign and move to the reservation with a few of the Salish people. Garfield never convinced Charlo to sign, although the official treaty document voted on by Congress bore his forged mark.\nIn 1876, Garfield developed a trapezoid proof of the Pythagorean theorem, which was published in the New England Journal of Education.
