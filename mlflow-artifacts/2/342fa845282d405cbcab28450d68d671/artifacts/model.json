Mishra counters him by exposing how most of Khaitan's projects are financed through loans from nationalised banks, and how economic expert Milind Desai's report on the 'Boston to Bikaner' project is biased, since his firm prepares reports almost exclusively for Khaitan's company. He also explains how Khaitan uses small developers like Bharadwaj to defraud indebted farmers like Rajaram Solanki, acquiring land dirt cheap and selling it at a premium. Tyagi then enters the courtroom with a witness—a seriously injured Sengupta, whom Tyagi met while in the hospital, who testifies that he received bribes from Khaitan, and the bullet removed from his body came from Shekhawat's registered rifle. Tyagi concludes his argument by showing Khaitan, Vikram, and Justice Tripathi pictures of their homes and saying that they need to be demolished for progress, asking why only the poor and vulnerable like Rajaram and Janki, should always be the people making sacrifices for the nation, rather than the rich and influential like Khaitan and Vikram.\nJustice Tripathi delivers his verdict, ruling that Khaitan's land purchases for the project are illegal due to multiple violations of the Land Acquisition Act. He also orders a judicial inquiry into the circumstances of Rajaram and Varsha's suicides, and the violence in Parsaul. The film ends with Tyagi and Mishra celebrated by the villagers, the slogan of Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan, and asks viewers to thank a farmer when they have their next meal.",

Sheen told NBC's Today, \"I stayed very calm and focused.\" According to People, social services took the children after Mueller obtained a restraining order against Sheen. The document said, \"I am very concerned that [Sheen] is currently insane.\" Asked if he would fight for the children, Sheen texted People, \"Born ready. Winning.\" Sheen and Mueller's divorce became final on May 2, 2011.\nOn March 1, 2011, Sheen was concurrently living with 24-year-old pornographic actress Bree Olson and 24-year-old model and graphic designer Natalie Kenly, whom he collectively nicknamed his \"goddesses\".

During his Senate run in 2004, he said he supported civil unions and domestic partnerships for same-sex partners but opposed same-sex marriages. In 2008, he reaffirmed this position by stating \"I believe marriage is between a man and a woman. I am not in favor of gay marriage.\" On May 9, 2012, shortly after the official launch of his campaign for re-election as president, Obama said his views had evolved, and he publicly affirmed his personal support for the legalization of same-sex marriage, becoming the first sitting U.S. president to do so. During his second inaugural address on January 21, 2013, Obama became the first U.S. president in office to call for full equality for gay Americans, and the first to mention gay rights or the word \"gay\" in an inaugural address. In 2013, the Obama administration filed briefs that urged the Supreme Court to rule in favor of same-sex couples in the cases of Hollingsworth v. Perry (regarding same-sex marriage) and United States v. Windsor (regarding the Defense of Marriage Act).",
