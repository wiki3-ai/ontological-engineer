The former, in which Khan played an ambiguous avenger who murders his girlfriend, shocked Indian audiences with an unexpected violation of the standard Bollywood formula. In The Cambridge Companion to Modern Indian Culture, Sonal Khullar called the character \"the consummate anti-hero\". His performance in Baazigar, which would be his first of many appearances with actress Kajol, won Khan his first Filmfare Award for Best Actor. In 2003, the Encyclopaedia of Hindi Cinema stated that Khan \"defied the image of the conventional hero in both these films and created his own version of the revisionist hero\". Darr marked the first of Khan's many collaborations with filmmaker Yash Chopra and his company Yash Raj Films. Khan's stammering and the use of the phrase \"I love you, K-k-k-Kiran\" were popular with audiences. Malini Mannath of The Indian Express argued that he \"walks away with the acting honours in yet another negative role\". For Darr he received a nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Performance in a Negative Role, also known as the Best Villain Award, but lost to Paresh Rawal for Sir.

Key claims include her release of \"Hey You\", signing with Live Nation, producing a documentary, directing a film, receiving Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction, working on \"Hard Candy\", and achieving chart success with \"4 Minutes\". Each statement should preserve the markdown links if present (though there are none in this text) and contain exactly one verifiable claim."]]}
