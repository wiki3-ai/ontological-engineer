Parentalia involved a commemorative meal at the graves of relatives, during which food and drink were offered to the dead, and Christian Romans continued this custom, extending it to the saints and martyrs. \nThere is evidence that by 800, churches in Ireland and Northumbria were holding a feast commemorating all saints on 1 November. In 835, the Frankish Empire officially adopted 1 November as the date of All Saints' Day. This may have been promoted by Alcuin of Northumbria, who was a member of Charlemagne's court, or by the Irish clerics and scholars who were also members of the Frankish court. Some suggest the date was due to Celtic influence; others, that it was a Germanic idea, although it is said that both Germanic- and Celtic-speaking peoples commemorated the dead at the beginning of winter. They may have seen it as the most fitting time to do so, as it is a time of \"dying\" in nature. It is also suggested the change was made on the \"practical grounds that Rome in summer could not accommodate the great number of pilgrims who flocked to it\", and perhaps because of public health concerns over Roman Fever, which claimed a number of lives during Rome's sultry summers.","Halloween > Christian origins and historical customs",["[Parentalia](\/wiki\/Parentalia) involved a commemorative meal at the graves of relatives.","During [Parentalia](\/wiki\/Parentalia), food and drink were offered to the dead.","[Christian Romans](\/wiki\/Christian_Romans) continued the [Parentalia](\/wiki\/Parentalia) custom.","[Christian Romans](\/wiki\/Christian_Romans) extended the [Parentalia](\/wiki\/Parentalia) custom to saints and martyrs.","There is evidence that by 800, churches in [Ireland](\/wiki\/Ireland) were holding a feast commemorating all saints on November 1.","There is evidence that by 800, churches in [Northumbria](\/wiki\/Northumbria) were holding a feast commemorating all saints on November 1.","In 835, the [Frankish Empire](\/wiki\/Frankish_Empire) officially adopted November 1 as the date of [All Saints' Day](\/wiki\/All_Saints'_Day).","The adoption of November 1 as [All Saints' Day](\/wiki\/All_Saints'_Day) may have been promoted by [Alcuin of Northumbria](\/wiki\/Alcuin_of_Northumbria).","[Alcuin of Northumbria](\/wiki\/Alcuin_of_Northumbria) was a member of [Charlemagne](\/wiki\/Charlemagne)'s court.","The adoption of November 1 as [All Saints' Day](\/wiki\/All_Saints'_Day) may have been promoted by [Irish clerics and scholars](\/wiki\/Irish_clerics_and_scholars) who were members of the [Frankish court](\/wiki\/Frankish_court).","Some suggest the date of November 1 was due to [Celtic influence](\/wiki\/Celtic_influence).","Others suggest the date of November 1 was a [Germanic idea](\/wiki\/Germanic_idea).","Both [Germanic](\/wiki\/Germanic)- and [Celtic-speaking peoples](\/wiki\/Celtic-speaking_peoples) commemorated the dead at the beginning of winter.","They may have seen November 1 as the most fitting time to commemorate the dead because it is a time of 'dying' in nature.","It is suggested the change was made on practical grounds that [Rome](\/wiki\/Rome) in summer could not accommodate the great number of pilgrims who flocked to it.","Public health concerns over [Roman Fever](\/wiki\/Roman_Fever) may have contributed to the choice of date.","The [Roman Fever](\/wiki\/Roman_Fever) claimed a number of lives during Rome's sultry summers."],"The chunk discusses the Christian origins and historical customs of Halloween, particularly focusing on the development of All Saints' Day.

The former, in which Khan played an ambiguous avenger who murders his girlfriend, shocked Indian audiences with an unexpected violation of the standard Bollywood formula. In The Cambridge Companion to Modern Indian Culture, Sonal Khullar called the character \"the consummate anti-hero\". His performance in Baazigar, which would be his first of many appearances with actress Kajol, won Khan his first Filmfare Award for Best Actor. In 2003, the Encyclopaedia of Hindi Cinema stated that Khan \"defied the image of the conventional hero in both these films and created his own version of the revisionist hero\". Darr marked the first of Khan's many collaborations with filmmaker Yash Chopra and his company Yash Raj Films. Khan's stammering and the use of the phrase \"I love you, K-k-k-Kiran\" were popular with audiences. Malini Mannath of The Indian Express argued that he \"walks away with the acting honours in yet another negative role\".

In a 2000 BBC poll, he was voted as the greatest man of the millennium.\nThe word Mahatma, while often mistaken for Gandhi's given name in the West, is taken from the Sanskrit words maha (meaning Great) and atma (meaning Soul). He was publicly bestowed with the honorific title \"Mahatma\" in July 1914 at farewell meeting in Town Hall, Durban. Rabindranath Tagore is said to have accorded the title to Gandhi by 1915. In his autobiography, Gandhi nevertheless explains that he never valued the title, and was often pained by it.\n\nInnumerable streets, roads, and localities in India are named after Gandhi.
