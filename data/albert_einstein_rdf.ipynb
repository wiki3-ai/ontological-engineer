    "\n",
    "This notebook contains RDF triples in Turtle format, one cell per source facts cell.\n",
    "Each cell corresponds to factual statements from the facts notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "An LLM/agent processes this notebook by:\n",
    "1. Reading the corresponding facts cell\n",
    "2. Converting statements to RDF using schema.org vocabulary\n",
    "3. Entity URIs use source URL with fragment identifiers (e.g., `<#person_albert_einstein>`)\n",
    "\n",
    "Triples can be edited, corrected, or expanded by humans before final export.\n",
    "\n",

    "- Use schema.org properties (schema:birthDate, schema:birthPlace, schema:worksFor, etc.)\n",
    "- For relationships not in schema.org, use wiki3: prefix\n",
    "- Include rdfs:label for entities\n",
    "- Use xsd datatypes for dates and numbers\n",
    "- Entity URIs should use the source URL as base with fragment identifiers\n",
