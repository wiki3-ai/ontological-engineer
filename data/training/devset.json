Investigators excavated the grounds of his property until they had exposed the substratum of clay beneath the foundations, finding 29 bodies.\nShortly after his arrest, Gacy informed investigators that after he had assaulted and then released Jeffrey Rignall in March 1978, he began to throw his murder victims into the Des Plaines River. He confessed to having disposed of five bodies in this manner; however, only four bodies recovered from the Des Plaines River were linked to him. When asked whether there were more victims, Gacy stated, \"That's for you guys to find out.\"\nDisputed DNA and dental tests conducted between 2012 and 2016 indicate that neither body found in the common grave in Gacy's crawl space and identified as those of Kenneth Parker and Michael Marino in 1980 was actually Marino. Marino's mother had always doubted her son's identification because the clothing found on Body 14 was inconsistent with what he had worn when she last saw him. DNA testing conducted on the exhumed body of Parker has proven that Marino's body had not been mistaken for his. In addition, the dental X-ray conducted on the victim identified as Michael Marino had revealed he had all of his second molars; a dental X-ray conducted on Marino in March 1976 revealed one molar had not erupted",

The step was intended to bring more and more candidates from these social groups in lower judiciary.\nIn order to strengthen his outreach and acceptability among the members of Extremely Backward Castes, and to expand his voter base beyond his traditional vote bank, Nitish Kumar embarked on a project to promote EBC leaders within his party. In 2005, a less known leader from the Kahar caste, Chandeshwar Prasad grabbed his attention and Kumar promoted him by making the head of Extremely Backward Caste wing of his party. He was also given significant positions like those of membership of syndicate of Magadh University. At the behest of Nitish Kumar, National Democratic Alliance in 2019 projected Prasad as the candidate for Indian General Elections from Jahanabad Lok Sabha constituency, which was believed to be a Bhumihar caste dominated constituency.

His mother, Laurie McLaurin (1922\u20132001), was a former model from Jackson, Mississippi, whose great-grandfather was Mississippi senator and governor Anselm J. McLaurin. Williams had two older half-brothers: a paternal half-brother, Robert (also known as Todd), and a maternal half-brother, McLaurin. While his mother was a practitioner of Christian Science, Williams was raised in his father's Episcopal faith. During a television interview on Inside the Actors Studio in 2001, Williams credited his mother as an important early influence on his humor, and he tried to make her laugh to gain attention.\nWilliams attended public elementary school at Gorton Elementary School in Lake Forest and later Deer Path Junior High School. He described himself as a quiet child who did not overcome his shyness until becoming involved with his high school drama department, while friends recalled him as being very funny. In late 1963, when Williams was 12, his father was transferred to Detroit.

To fiscal conservatives in the Republican Party, Bush's statement represented a betrayal, and they heavily criticized him for compromising so early in the negotiations.\nIn September 1990, Bush and congressional Democrats announced a compromise to cut mandatory and discretionary programs funding while raising revenue, partly through a higher gas tax. The compromise additionally included a \"pay as you go\" provision that required that new programs be paid for at the time of implementation. House minority whip Newt Gingrich led the conservative opposition to the bill, strongly opposing any form of tax increase. Some liberals also criticized the budget cuts in the compromise, and in October, the House rejected the deal, resulting in a brief government shutdown.

It is a direct sequel to the fourth season of the anime television series as well as the manga fourth, fifth, and sixth adaptations, following the film Mugen Train (2020) and the feature-length compilations To the Swordsmith Village (2023) and To the Hashira Training (2024). It is directed by Haruo Sotozaki, produced by Ufotable, and written by the studio's staff members. It follows the Demon Slayer Corps in their decisive climactic battle against Muzan Kibutsuji and the remaining Upper Ranks within the titular \"Infinity Castle\".\nUnlike the Swordsmith Village and Hashira Training adaptations, which are compilations of episodes from the anime series, Infinity Castle is a feature-length multi-film adaptation due to the arc's content and dramatic pacing, similarly to Mugen Train. It is the first film of a trilogy announced in June 2024, immediately following the airing of the fourth season's finale.\nIt was released in Japan on July 18, 2025, by Aniplex and Toho. It was released by Crunchyroll through Sony Pictures Releasing in select Asian countries in August, before releasing in all other territories the following month",

The memory includes the home front, military affairs, the treatment of soldiers, both living and dead, in the war's aftermath, depictions of the war in literature and art, evaluations of heroes and villains, and considerations of the moral and political lessons of the war. The last theme includes moral evaluations of racism and slavery, heroism and cowardice in combat and behind the lines, and issues of democracy and minority rights, as well as the notion of an \"Empire of Liberty\" influencing the world.\nHistorians have paid more attention to the causes of the war than to the war itself. Military history has largely developed outside academia, leading to a proliferation of studies by non-scholars who nevertheless are familiar with the primary sources and pay close attention to battles and campaigns and who write for the general public. Practically every major figure in the war, both North and South, has had a serious biographical study.\nEven the name used for the conflict has been controversial, with many names used for it. During and immediately after the war, Northern historians often used a term like \"War of the Rebellion\". Writers in rebel states often referred to the \"War for Southern Independence\".

BJP-aligned lawyer Ram Jethmalani termed the act as \"retrogressive obscurantism for short-term minority populism\". Rajiv Gandhi's colleague Arif Mohammad Khan who was INC member and a minister in Gandhi's cabinet resigned from the post and party in protest.\nCritics of the Act point out that while divorce is within the purview of personal laws, maintenance is not, and thus it is discriminatory to exclude Muslim women from a civil law. Exclusion of non-Muslim men from a law that appears inherently beneficial to men is also pointed out by them.

Imagery of the skull, a reference to Golgotha in the Christian tradition, serves as \"a reminder of death and the transitory quality of human life\" and is consequently found in memento mori and vanitas compositions; skulls have therefore been commonplace in Halloween, which touches on this theme. Traditionally, the back walls of churches are \"decorated with a depiction of the Last Judgment, complete with graves opening and the dead rising, with a heaven filled with angels and a hell filled with devils\", a motif that has permeated the observance of this triduum. One of the earliest works on the subject of Halloween is from Scottish poet John Mayne, who, in 1780, made note of pranks at Halloween\u2014\"What fearfu' pranks ensue!\", as well as the supernatural associated with the night, \"bogles\" (ghosts)\u2014influencing Robert Burns' \"Halloween\" (1785). Elements of the autumn season, such as pumpkins, corn husks, autumn leaves, and scarecrows, are also prevalent. Homes are often decorated with these types of symbols around Halloween. Halloween imagery includes themes of death, evil, and mythical monsters",

The original stadium was designed by the renowned football architect Archibald Leitch, and had a design common to many football grounds in the UK at the time, with a single covered stand and three open-air banks of terracing. The entire stadium was given a massive overhaul in the 1930s: new Art Deco West and East stands were constructed, opening in 1932 and 1936 respectively, and a roof was added to the North Bank terrace, which was bombed during the Second World War and not restored until 1954.\nHighbury could hold more than 60,000 spectators at its peak, and had a capacity of 57,000 until the early 1990s. The Taylor Report and Premier League regulations obliged Arsenal to convert Highbury to an all-seater stadium in time for the 1993\u201394 season, thus reducing the capacity to 38,419 seated spectators",

Some claims revolve around the insignificance of slavery as a cause; some appeals highlight cultural differences between North and South; the military conflict by Confederate actors is idealized; in any case, secession was said to be lawful.

It tied Nolan Ryan for most strikeouts in a no-hitter, was the first no-hitter produced with at least 17 strikeouts and no walks, and made Scherzer the sixth pitcher in MLB history to record multiple no-hitters in one season. With a game score of 104, it was the second-highest achieved on record and made Scherzer the first to achieve multiple game scores of at least 100 in the same season. That game won the 2015 Esurance MLB Award for Best Performance.\nBecause of his three most brilliant performances that season, Scherzer became the first to assemble three-game scores of 97 or higher in one season since at least 1914. Ryan and Walter Johnson (1918) were the only two other pitchers to carry out three-game scores of 95 or more in one season",

Bill and his friends, known collectively as the Loser's Club, investigate the disappearances and note that they all had something to do with Derry's sewer system; using this information, they deduce correctly that he uses a well house as a lair. Through the use of a Native American-style smoke-hole ceremony, it is revealed that the creature came from outer space. The children go to the house and are attacked by him in the form of a werewolf. Beverly shoots a slug from a slingshot at the creature, injuring Pennywise and causing him to flee back into the sewers. The narrative then briefly switches to his point of view, where he sees himself as superior and considers the Turtle an equal and humans mere \"toys.\" He also confirms that he chooses to prey on children because they are easier to fool and scare. He believes their fears are easier to interpret in a physical manner, which he claims is similar to \"salting the meat\", as frightened flesh tastes better to him. Bill establishes a telepathic connection with Pennywise through the Ritual of Ch\u00fcd. The Ritual of Ch\u00fcd is a psychic and spiritual battle of wills between Bill and Pennywise. Bill metaphorically \"bites down\" on Pennywise's tongue with humor and childish beliefs such as Santa Claus, and the two engage in a sort of mind-to-mind duel across the macroverse",

However, its smooth proceedings were derailed by the student movement; this created a major embarrassment (\"loss of face\") for the leadership on the global stage and drove many moderates in government onto a more hardline path. The summit between Deng and Gorbachev took place at the Great Hall of the People amid the backdrop of commotion and protest in the square. When Gorbachev met with Zhao on 16 May, Zhao told him, and by extension the international press, that Deng was still the \"paramount authority\" in China.

It's more organic, it's more sheer. It has a whimsical, floppy quality to it. It's not a direct translation of a ruff or a whisk, which were two of the collars popular during the Elizabethan period.\"\nBryant played with multiple eras as a way of reflecting Pennywise's immortality and added a \"doll-like quality to the costume.\" She furthered this by stating \"The pants being short, the high waistline of the jacket, and the fit of the costume is a very important element.

The Endurance, the crew's mother ship, is a circular structure consisting of 12 capsules, laid flat to mimic a clock: Four capsules with planetary settling equipment, four with engines, and four with the permanent functions of cockpit, medical labs, and habitation. Production designer Nathan Crowley said the Endurance was based on the International Space Station: \"It's a real mish-mash of different kinds of technology. You need analogue stuff, as well as digital stuff, you need backup systems and tangible switches. It's really like a submarine in space. Every inch of space is used, everything has a purpose.\" The ranger's function is similar to the Space Shuttle's, being able to enter and exit planetary atmospheres. Lastly, the lander transports the capsules with settling equipment to planetary surfaces. Crowley compared it to \"a heavy Russian helicopter.\"\nThe film features two robots, CASE and TARS, as well as a dismantled third robot, KIPP. Nolan wanted to avoid making the robots anthropomorphic and chose a 1.5 m (4.9 ft) quadrilateral design. He said: \"It has a very complicated design philosophy. It's based on mathematics.

On the other hand, the media differed over the handling of ideas, often singling out the film's supernatural elements for further scrutiny, with one review from Variety claiming its emphasis undermined tension-building in the story.

He reprised his opposition to the greenback, saying, \"Any party which commits itself to paper money will go down amid the general disaster, covered with the curses of a ruined people.\" In 1868 Garfield gave a two-hour speech on currency in the House, which was widely applauded as his best oratory to that point; in it, he advocated a gradual resumption of specie payments, that is, the government paying out silver and gold, rather than paper money that could not be redeemed.\nTariffs had been raised to high levels during the Civil War. Afterward, Garfield, who made a close study of financial affairs, advocated moving toward free trade, though the standard Republican position was a protective tariff that would allow American industries to grow. This break with his party likely cost him his place on the Ways and Means Committee in 1867, and though Republicans held the majority in the House until 1875, Garfield remained off that committee.

At the Democratic National Convention in Charlotte, North Carolina, Obama and Joe Biden were formally nominated by former president Bill Clinton as the Democratic Party candidates for president and vice president in the general election. Their main opponents were Republicans Mitt Romney, the former governor of Massachusetts, and Representative Paul Ryan of Wisconsin.\nOn November 6, 2012, Obama won 332 electoral votes, exceeding the 270 required for him to be reelected as president. With 51.1 percent of the popular vote, Obama became the first Democratic president since Franklin D. Roosevelt to win the majority of the popular vote twice. Obama addressed supporters and volunteers at Chicago's McCormick Place after his reelection and said: \"Tonight you voted for action, not politics as usual. You elected us to focus on your jobs, not ours. And in the coming weeks and months, I am looking forward to reaching out and working with leaders of both parties.\"",

In 2020, ProPublica investigated TPUSA's finances and found that the organization made \"misleading financial claims\", that the audits were not done by an independent auditor, and that the leaders had enriched themselves while advocating for Trump. ProPublica also reported that Kirk's salary from TPUSA had increased from $27,000 to nearly $300,000 and that he had bought an $855,000 condo in Longboat Key, Florida.

Among those named were Vice President Schuyler Colfax, Massachusetts Senator Henry Wilson (the Republican candidate for vice president), Speaker James G. Blaine of Maine, and Garfield. Greeley had little luck taking advantage of the scandal. When Congress reconvened after the election, Blaine, seeking to clear his name, demanded a House investigation. Evidence before the special committee exonerated Blaine. Garfield had said in September 1872 that Ames had offered him stock but he had repeatedly refused it. Testifying before the committee in January, Ames said he had offered Garfield ten shares of stock at par value, but that Garfield had never taken them or paid for them, though a year passed, from 1867 to 1868, before Garfield had finally refused. Appearing before the committee on January 14, 1873, Garfield confirmed much of this. Ames testified several weeks later that Garfield agreed to take the stock on credit, and that it was paid for by the company's huge dividends. The two men differed over $300 that Garfield received and later paid back, with Garfield deeming it a loan and Ames a dividend.\nGarfield's biographers have been unwilling to exonerate him in the scandal. Allan Peskin writes, \"Did Garfield lie? Not exactly. Did he tell the truth? Not completely. Was he corrupted? Not really",

Madonna told a Playboy writer in 1985 that \"they didn't want me for [...] Hernandez, they wanted to bring me to Paris and make me a disco star\". During her little time with Hernandez's troupe, she also traveled to Tunisia and several disco-oriented European countries before returning to New York that same year. Madonna relocated to an abandoned synagogue in Corona, Queens, where Gilroy and his brother Ed resided and practiced. The group slept in the basement and used its meeting space both to rehearse and record music for their band, Breakfast Club, for which Madonna sang and played drums and guitar.\nMadonna made her acting debut in the low-budget indie film A Certain Sacrifice, which was shot in two parts in 1979 and 1981. She attempted to block its release through legal action against director Stephen Jon Lewicki but was unsuccessful, and the film was released in 1985. It was primarily criticized for its explicit sexual and violent content.

He said in his autobiography that his own influence had led to both Chief Prosecutor Saypol and Judge Irving Kaufman being appointed to the case. Cohn further said that Kaufman imposed the death penalty based on his personal recommendation. Cohn denied, however, participation in any illegal ex parte discussions.\nConsensus among historians is that Julius Rosenberg was guilty of being a highly valued NKVD spymaster against the United States, but that his trial was marred by prosecutorial misconduct\u2014mainly by Cohn\u2014and that the Rosenbergs should not have been executed.

In England, the ending of official ceremonies related to the intercession of saints led to the development of new, unofficial Allhallowtide customs. In 18th- and 19th-century rural Lancashire, Catholic families gathered on hills on the night of All Hallows' Eve and one person held a bunch of burning straw on a pitchfork while the rest knelt around him, praying for the souls of relatives and friends until the flames went out. This was known as teen'lay. There was a similar custom in Hertfordshire, and the lighting of \"tindle\" fires in Derbyshire. Some suggested that these fires were originally lit to \"guide the poor souls back to earth\". In Scotland and Ireland, old Allhallowtide customs that were at odds with Reformed teaching were not suppressed because they \"were important to the life cycle and rites of passage of local communities\" and so curbing them would have been difficult.\nOn All Saints' Day and All Souls' Day during the 19th century, candles were lit in homes in Ireland, Flanders, Bavaria, and in Tyrol, where they were called \"soul lights\", that served \"to guide the souls back to visit their earthly homes\"",

Such an act requires majority support of two-thirds of both chambers.\nBefore 1980, many federal agencies continued to operate during shutdowns, while minimizing all nonessential operations and obligations, believing that Congress did not intend agencies to close while waiting for the enactment of annual appropriations acts or temporary appropriations.

In contrast to the Zulu War of 1906 and the outbreak of World War I in 1914, when he recruited volunteers for the Ambulance Corps, this time Gandhi attempted to recruit combatants. In a June 1918 leaflet entitled \"Appeal for Enlistment\", Gandhi wrote: \"To bring about such a state of things we should have the ability to defend ourselves, that is, the ability to bear arms and to use them... If we want to learn the use of arms with the greatest possible despatch, it is our duty to enlist ourselves in the army.\" However, Gandhi stipulated in a letter to the Viceroy's private secretary that he \"personally will not kill or injure anybody, friend or foe.\"\nGandhi's support for the war campaign brought into question his consistency on nonviolence. Gandhi's private secretary noted that \"The question of the consistency between his creed of 'Ahimsa' (nonviolence) and his recruiting campaign was raised not only then but has been discussed ever since.\" According to political and educational scientist Christian Bartolf, Gandhi's support for the war stemmed from his belief that true ahimsa could not exist simultaneously with cowardice",

On September 21, it was reported that Jonathan Bailey had joined the cast as Fiyero, beating, among others, Cooper Koch, Nick Jonas, and Joe Jonas for the role. In October 2022, it was announced that Jeff Goldblum was in final talks to star as the Wizard. Goldblum completed talks by December, when Ethan Slater, Michelle Yeoh, Marissa Bode, Bowen Yang, Bronwyn James, Keala Settle, Aaron Teoh, and Colin Michael Carmichael were also added to the cast.

From the Union perspective, the goals of Reconstruction were to consolidate victory by reuniting the Union, to guarantee a \"republican form of government\" for the ex-Confederate states, and to permanently end slavery\u2014and prevent semi-slavery status.\nPresident Johnson, who took office in April 1865, took a lenient approach and saw the achievement of the main war goals as realized in 1865, when each ex-rebel state repudiated secession and ratified the Thirteenth Amendment. Radical Republicans demanded proof that Confederate nationalism was dead and that the slaves were truly free. They overrode Johnson's vetoes of civil rights legislation, and the House impeached him, although the Senate did not convict him. In 1868 and 1872, the Republican candidate Grant won the presidency. In 1872, the \"Liberal Republicans\" argued that the war goals had been achieved and Reconstruction should end. They chose Horace Greeley to head a presidential ticket in 1872 but were decisively defeated. In 1874, Democrats, primarily Southern, took control of Congress and opposed further reconstruction. The Compromise of 1877 closed with a national consensus, except on the part of former slaves, that the war had finally ended. With the withdrawal of federal troops, however, white men retook control of every Southern legislature, and the Jim Crow era of disenfranchisement and legal segregation was ushered in.\nThe war had a demonstrable impact on American politics",

An estimated 70 million Americans, about two-thirds of the electorate, watched the first debate on September 26. Kennedy had met the day before with the producer to discuss the set design and camera placement. Nixon, recently released from the hospital after a painful knee injury, did not take advantage of this opportunity and, during the debate, looked at the reporters asking questions and not at the camera. Kennedy wore a blue suit and shirt to reduce glare and appeared sharply focused against the gray studio background. Nixon wore a light-colored suit that blended into the gray background; in combination with the harsh studio lighting that left Nixon perspiring, he offered a less-than-commanding presence. By contrast, Kennedy appeared relaxed, tanned, and telegenic, looking into the camera while answering questions. It is often claimed that television viewers overwhelmingly believed Kennedy, appearing to be the more attractive of the two, had won, while radio listeners (a smaller audience) thought Nixon had defeated him. However, only one poll split TV and radio voters like this and the methodology was poor. Pollster Elmo Roper concluded that the debates raised interest, boosted turnout, and gave Kennedy an estimated two million additional votes, largely due to the first debate",

It also has aspects of a harvest festival, even though the harvest in New England occurs well before the late-November date on which the modern Thanksgiving holiday is celebrated.\nIn the English tradition, days of thanksgiving and special thanksgiving religious services became important during the English Reformation in the reign of Henry VIII. Before 1536 there were 95 Church holidays, plus every Sunday, when people were required to attend church and forego work. Though the 1536 reforms in the Church of England reduced the number of holidays in the liturgical calendar to 27, the Puritan party in the Anglican Church wished to eliminate all Church holidays apart from the weekly Lord's Day, including the evangelical feasts of Christmas and Easter (cf. Puritan Sabbatarianism). The holidays were to be replaced by specially called Days of Fasting and Days of Thanksgiving, in response to events that the Puritans viewed as acts of special providence. Unexpected disasters or threats of judgement from on high called for Days of Fasting.\nSpecial blessings, viewed as coming from God, called for Days of Thanksgiving, which were observed through Christian church services and other gatherings",

They also got input from Dan Perri, who worked on the title credits of several 1980s films. Various iterations included having letters vanish, to reflect the \"missing\" theme of the show, and having letters cast shadows on others, alluding to the mysteries, before settling into the sliding letters.

Cheney opposed the V-22 program, for which Congress had already appropriated funds, and initially refused to issue contracts for it before relenting. When the 1990 Budget came before Congress in the summer of 1989, it settled on a figure between the Administration's request and the House Armed Services Committee's recommendation.\nIn subsequent years under Cheney, the proposed and adopted budgets followed patterns similar to that of 1990.

A Bush sound bite, referring to the issue of overarching purpose as \"the vision thing\", has become a metonym applied to other political figures accused of similar difficulties. His ability to gain broad international support for the Gulf War and the war's result were seen as both a diplomatic and military triumph, rousing bipartisan approval, though his decision to withdraw without removing Saddam Hussein left mixed feelings, and attention returned to the domestic front and a souring economy. A New York Times article mistakenly depicted Bush as being surprised to see a supermarket barcode reader; the report of his reaction exacerbated the notion that he was \"out of touch\".\nBush was popular throughout most of his presidency. After the Gulf war concluded in February 1991, his approval rating saw a high of 89%, before gradually declining for the rest of the year, and eventually falling below 50% according to a January 1992 Gallup poll. His sudden drop in his favorability was likely due to the early 1990s recession, which shifted his image from \"conquering hero\" to \"politician befuddled by economic matters\". At the elite level, several commentators and political experts lamented the state of American politics in 1991\u20131992 and reported the voters were angry.

Rodgers was 19-for-34 for 178 yards and a touchdown, with two interceptions in the losing effort.\nRodgers finished the regular season first in touchdown-to-interception ratio (7.6), lowest interception percentage (1.0%), second in passer rating (112.2), yards per attempt (8.4), and touchdown passing percentage (7.1%), third in touchdown passes (38), seventh in passing yards (4,381), and ninth in completion percentage (65.6%)",

The main concept was to award points for matches played between all FIFA-affiliated national A teams, based on their results over the past eight years in FIFA-recognised matches (friendly matches, qualifying and finals matches for the World Cup, and qualifying and final matches for a Continental championship): Three points for a win, one point for a draw and no points for a loss.\n\nResults were not included from matches played by the FIFA association's: B teams, C teams, League XI teams, Women, U17, U20, U23 and futsal teams.\nThe calculation formula was adjusted by the following factors:",

After considering various options, in 2000 Arsenal proposed building a new 60,361-capacity stadium at Ashburton Grove, since named the Emirates Stadium, about 500 metres south-west of Highbury. The project was initially delayed by red tape and rising costs, and construction was completed in July 2006, in time for the start of the 2006\u201307 season. The stadium was named after its sponsors, the airline company Emirates, with whom the club signed the largest sponsorship deal in English football history, worth around \u00a3100 million. Some fans referred to the ground as Ashburton Grove, or the Grove, as they did not agree with corporate sponsorship of stadium names.

Slaves in the border states and those in some former Confederate territory occupied before the Emancipation Proclamation were freed by state action or (on December 6, 1865) by the Thirteenth Amendment. The Emancipation Proclamation enabled African Americans, both free blacks and escaped slaves, to join the Union Army. About 190,000 volunteered, further enhancing the numerical advantage the Union armies enjoyed over the Confederates, who did not dare emulate the equivalent manpower source for fear of undermining the legitimacy of slavery.\nDuring the war, sentiment concerning slaves, enslavement, and emancipation in the United States was divided. Lincoln's fears of making slavery a war issue were based on a harsh reality: abolition did not enjoy wide support in the west, the territories, and the border states. In 1861, Lincoln worried that premature attempts at emancipation would mean the loss of the border states, and that \"to lose Kentucky is nearly the same as to lose the whole game\"",

Freeman wrote that the army received its final name from Lee when he issued orders assuming command on June 1, 1862. However, Freeman wrote, Lee corresponded with Brigadier General Joseph E. Johnston, his predecessor in army command, before that date and referred to Johnston's command as the Army of Northern Virginia. Part of the confusion results from the fact that Johnston commanded the Department of Northern Virginia as of October 22, 1861, and the name Army of Northern Virginia was seen as an informal consequence of its parent department's name",

When the harvest was finally collected, communities would come together for a harvest supper. When Christianity arrived in Britain many traditions remained, and today the Harvest Festival is marked by churches and schools in late September/early October (same as Canada) with singing, praying and decorating with baskets of food and fruit to celebrate a successful harvest and to give thanks. Collections of food are usually held which are then given to local charities which help the homeless and those in need.\nHistorically, the Eastern Counties celebration of hockey (more recently spelled \"horkey\" to distinguish it from the sport of the same name) bore a close resemblance to Thanksgiving feasts.

Similarly, many contemporary Protestant churches view Halloween as a fun event for children, holding events in their churches where children and their parents can dress up, play games, and get candy for free. To these Christians, Halloween holds no threat to the spiritual lives of children: being taught about death and mortality, and the ways of the Celtic ancestors actually being a valuable life lesson and a part of many of their parishioners' heritage. Christian minister Sam Portaro wrote that Halloween is about using \"humor and ridicule to confront the power of death\".\nIn the Catholic Church, Halloween's Christian connection is acknowledged, and Halloween celebrations are common in many Catholic parochial schools, such as in the United States, while schools throughout Ireland also close for the Halloween break",

The common thread running through these ideas was that Howard wanted to do a film similar to Disney's Robin Hood, which also featured animals in anthropomorphic roles. According to Howard, Zootopia emerged from his desire to create something different from other animal anthropomorphic films, where animals either live in the natural world or in the human world. His concept, in which animals live in a modern world designed by animals for animals, was well received by Lasseter, who responded by embracing and lifting Howard \"in the air like a baby Simba\". Lasseter suggested that Howard should try combining the 1960s theme with the animal characters, especially the space pug. This led Howard to develop and pitch Savage Seas, an international spy film centered on an arctic hare named \"Jack Savage\" who was somewhat like James Bond",

After his first training session with the senior squad, Bar\u00e7a's new star player, Ronaldinho, told his teammates that he believed the 16-year-old would become an even better player than himself. Ronaldinho soon befriended Messi, whom he called \"little brother\". This greatly eased Messi's transition into the first team.\nTo gain further match experience, Messi joined Barcelona C in addition to the Juvenil A, playing his first game for the third team on 29 November. He helped save them from the relegation zone of the Tercera Divisi\u00f3n, scoring five goals in ten games, including a hat-trick in eight minutes during a Copa del Rey Juvenil match while man-marked by Sevilla's Sergio Ramos. His progress was reflected in his first professional contract, signed on 4 February 2004, which lasted until 2012 and contained an initial buyout clause of \u20ac30 million. A month later, on 6 March, he made his debut for Barcelona B in the Segunda Divisi\u00f3n B, and his buyout clause automatically increased to \u20ac80 million.

Although the large majority of contests have been played entirely during the month of October, a small number of Series have also had games played during September and November. The Series-winning team is awarded the Commissioner's Trophy. Players, coaches and others associated with the team are generally given World Series rings to commemorate their victory; however, they have received other items such as pocket watches and medallions in the past.\nA total of 121 World Series have been contested through 2025, with the AL champion winning 68 and the NL champion winning 53.

The narrative structure is similar to the novel, using flashbacks to show the children's encounters with Pennywise as the adult Losers recollect their past. In the miniseries, the character fulfills a largely identical role to that of the novel, preying on children before entering a long cycle of hibernation. The most notable change is that Pennywise's resting period is extended from twenty-seven to thirty years.\nIndieWire's Jamie Righetti says the most obvious difference between the book and the films is the time difference \u2014 the novel, for instance, has Georgie's death in 1957 and Pennywise's final defeat in 1985, but the films have these events in 1989 and 2016 respectively. Righetti also notes that in the film the characters do not manage to recover Georgie's body. The classic horror movie villains Pennywise shapeshifts into are also gone from the films.  Similar to the novel and miniseries, the character feeds on fear, targeting children because they are easier to scare. In the 2017 film, Pennywise says that fear is \"tasty\" and \"beautiful\", but does not go into much more detail than that in either film.\nThe Ritual of Ch\u00fcd is completely absent in the first film, and the fight between the child Losers and Pennywise is a purely physical one.

The British negotiators proposed constitutional reforms on a British Dominion model that established separate electorates based on religious and social divisions. The British questioned the Congress party and Gandhi's authority to speak for all of India. They invited Indian religious leaders, such as Muslims and Sikhs, to press their demands along religious lines, as well as B. R. Ambedkar as the representative leader of the untouchables. Gandhi vehemently opposed a constitution that enshrined rights or representations based on communal divisions, because he feared that it would not bring people together but divide them, perpetuate their status, and divert the attention from India's struggle to end the colonial rule.\nThe Second Round Table conference was the only time Gandhi left India between 1914 and his death in 1948.

In 1989, all the Communist governments collapsed in Eastern Europe. Gorbachev declined to send in the Soviet military, effectively abandoning the Brezhnev Doctrine. The U.S. was not directly involved in these upheavals, but the Bush administration avoided gloating over the demise of the Eastern Bloc to avoid undermining further democratic reforms.\nBush and Gorbachev met at the Malta Summit in December 1989. Though many on the right remained wary of Gorbachev, Bush came away believing that Gorbachev would negotiate in good faith. For the remainder of his term, Bush sought cooperative relations with Gorbachev, believing he was the key to peace. The primary issue at the Malta Summit was the potential reunification of Germany. While Britain and France were wary of a reunified Germany, Bush joined German chancellor Helmut Kohl in pushing for German reunification.

She ran on the slogan \"Save America, Stop Socialism!\" In the days before the primary, Facebook took down a Greene video for violating its terms of service. In the video, Greene held an AR-15 style rifle and warned antifa groups to \"stay the hell out of Northwest Georgia\".\nGreene finished first in the June 9 primary. Trump tweeted, \"A big winner\".

They occurred after Clinton rejected 1996 spending bills proposed by congressional Republicans, who held majorities in both chambers, led by  House Speaker Newt Gingrich.\nBoth Gingrich and the majority of Congress sought to pass bills that would reduce government spending, much against Clinton's political objectives for 1996. Clinton objected to funding cuts affecting education, the environment, and public health. One proposed bill threatened to block a scheduled reduction he had planned towards premiums within Medicare. Both sides had differing opinions over the impact the proposed House bills would have over economic growth, medical inflation, and anticipated revenues, with Clinton vetoing the bills over amendments added to them by congressional Republicans, despite Gingrich threatening to refuse to raise the country's debt ceiling.\nThe first shutdown took place on November 14, 1995, after a CR issued on October 1 had expired, and meetings between Democratic and Republican leaders failed to end the deadlock. The effect of the deadlock led to the majority of government departments being closed down and 800,000 federal workers being furloughed as a result. Although the shutdown ended five days later on November 19, the political friction between Clinton and Gingrich over the US budget remained unresolved",

His favoured position in childhood was the playmaker behind two strikers, known as the enganche in Argentine football, but he began his career in Spain as a left-winger or left-sided forward. Upon his first-team debut, he was moved onto the right wing by manager Frank Rijkaard; from this position, he could more easily cut through the defence into the middle of the pitch and curl shots on goal with his left foot, rather than predominantly cross balls for teammates. Under Guardiola and subsequent managers, he most often played in a false nine role; positioned as a centre-forward or lone striker, he roamed the centre, often moving deep into midfield and drawing defenders with him, in order to create and exploit spaces for passes, other teammates' attacking runs off the ball, Messi's own dribbling runs, or combinations with Xavi and Iniesta.\nUnder the stewardship of Luis Enrique, Messi initially returned to playing in the right-sided position that characterised much of his early career in the manager's 4\u20133\u20133 formation, while he was increasingly deployed in a deeper, free playmaking role in later seasons.

Pixie was the brand-name of a popular inexpensive amateur camera of the era; while \"fairy\" is a derogatory term for a homosexual man. The people at the hearing recognized the implication, and found it amusing; Cohn later called the remark \"malicious\", \"wicked\", and \"indecent\".\nThe young Cohn also attached himself to several older powerful men who, in return, provided Cohn with assistance.

Francis Amasa Walker, superintendent of the 1870 census, used census and surgeon general data to estimate a minimum of 500,000 Union military deaths and 350,000 Confederate military deaths, a total of 850,000 soldiers. While Walker's estimates were originally dismissed because of the 1870 census's undercounting, it was later found that the census was only off by 6.5 percent and that the data Walker used would be roughly accurate.\nLosses were far higher than during the war with Mexico, which saw roughly 13,000 American deaths, including fewer than two thousand killed in battle, between 1846 and 1848.

All government forces then retreated to bases outside the city.\nDefying martial law, students entertained themselves with music, drinking, and smoking on the square. At the same time, internal divisions intensified within the student movement itself. By late May, the students became increasingly disorganised with no clear leadership or unified course of action. Moreover, Tiananmen Square was overcrowded and facing serious hygiene problems. Hou Dejian suggested an open election of the student leadership to speak for the movement but was met with opposition. Meanwhile, Wang Dan moderated his position, ostensibly sensing the impending military action and its consequences. He advocated for a temporary withdrawal from Tiananmen Square to re-group on campus, but this was opposed by hardline student factions who wanted to hold the square",

FIFA announced on 10 June 2018 that the ranking system would be updated following the 2018 World Cup finals. \nThe most significant change was to move away from a system in which points were accrued for victories or draws and then dropped after a certain date (as used in systems such as the ATP and WTA rankings in tennis), to a continuous rating system in which teams' points increase or decrease with the result of every match. In addition to this, the current calculation method abolishes the weightings designated for FIFA's continental confederations  and retained the 2006 changes which ascribed no value to whether a game was home or away, or to the margin of the victory, unlike several unofficial Elo-based ranking systems.\nFIFA had intended to introduce the new ranking system in July 2018 immediately after the FIFA World Cup, but with no matches scheduled between the July and August ranking dates, this was delayed until August 2018",

The idea was that a tax cut would stimulate consumer demand, which in turn would lead to higher economic growth, lower unemployment, and increased federal revenues. To the disappointment of liberals like John Kenneth Galbraith, Kennedy's embrace of the tax cut shifted his administration's focus away from the proposed old-age health insurance program and other domestic expenditures. In January 1963, Kennedy proposed a tax cut that would reduce the top marginal tax rate from 91 to 65 percent, and lower the corporate tax rate from 52 to 47 percent. The predictions according to the Keynesian model indicated the cuts would decrease income taxes by about $10 billion and corporate taxes by about $3.5 billion. The plan included reforms designed to reduce the impact of itemized deductions, as well as provisions to help the elderly and handicapped. Republicans and many Southern Democrats opposed the bill, calling for simultaneous reductions in expenditures, but debate continued throughout 1963. Three months after Kennedy died, Johnson pushed the plan through Congress. The Revenue Act of 1964 lowered the top individual rate to 70 percent, and the top corporate rate to 48 percent.",

The backlash to the tragedy was a tightening of regulations relating to safety, building codes and the frequency of inspections of attractions nationwide. The smaller venues, especially the nonprofit attractions, were unable to compete financially, and the better funded commercial enterprises filled the vacuum.

In order to avoid being recognized by any soul that might be seeking such vengeance, people would don masks or costumes\". In the Middle Ages, churches in Europe that were too poor to display relics of martyred saints at Allhallowtide let parishioners dress up as saints instead. Some Christians observe this custom at Halloween today. Lesley Bannatyne believes this could have been a Christianization of an earlier pagan custom. Many Christians in mainland Europe, especially in France, believed \"that once a year, on Hallowe'en, the dead of the churchyards rose for one wild, hideous carnival\" known as the danse macabre, which was often depicted in church decoration.

The two overtime defeats brought Rodgers' record in overtime games to 0\u20135.\nAt midseason, Rodgers had already thrown nine interceptions compared to only throwing seven all of the previous season, and was 16th in the league with an 85.3 passer rating. Over the remainder of the regular season, however, his play improved as he threw 16 touchdowns to only two interceptions, completed 71.4% of his passes, and had a passer rating of 122.0.\nIn Week 13, in a 34\u201316 victory over the San Francisco 49ers, Rodgers had 298 passing yards and three touchdowns to earn his first career NFC Offensive Player of the Week honor. In Week 14, he sustained his second concussion of the season. Backup Matt Flynn was put into the game as Rodgers' replacement. The Packers lost the game 7\u20133 to the Lions. Against the Patriots, Rodgers missed the next week's regular season start, ending his streak of consecutive starts at 45, which is tied for the second longest in team history.\nAfter their road loss to the Patriots, the Packers found themselves at 8\u20136 and had to win their final two regular season games to qualify for the playoffs",

Under this later-superseded format, the maximum number of games per team would have remained at seven, but each team would have played one fewer group match than before. The tournament still would have been completed within 32 days. The later-superseded format was chosen over three other proposals, ranging from 40 to 48 teams, from 76 to 88 matches, and from one to four minimum matches per team.\nCritics of the later-superseded format argued that the use of three-team groups with two teams progressing significantly increased the risk of collusion between teams. This prompted FIFA to suggest that penalty shootouts may be used to prevent draws in the group stage, although even then some risk of collusion would remain, and a possibility would emerge of teams deliberately losing shootouts to eliminate a rival. To address these concerns, FIFA continued considering alternative formats \u2013 a process that ended with the 2023 announcement that the format would be 12 groups of 4 teams.",

The danse macabre was sometimes enacted in European village pageants and court masques with people \"dressing up as corpses from various strata of society\", and this may be the origin of Halloween costume parties.\nIn Britain, these customs came under attack during the Reformation, as Protestants berated Purgatory as a \"popish\" doctrine incompatible with the Calvinist doctrine of predestination. State-sanctioned ceremonies associated with the intercession of saints and prayer for souls in Purgatory were abolished during the Elizabethan reform, though All Hallows' Day remained in the English liturgical calendar to \"commemorate saints as godly human beings\". For some Nonconformist Protestants, the theology of All Hallows' Eve was redefined: \"souls cannot be journeying from Purgatory on their way to Heaven, as Catholics frequently believe and assert. Instead, the so-called ghosts are thought to be in actuality evil spirits\". Other Protestants believed in an intermediate state known as Hades (Bosom of Abraham). In some localities, Catholics and Protestants continued souling, candlelit processions, or ringing church bells for the dead; but the Anglican Church eventually suppressed this bell-ringing. Professor of medieval archaeology Mark Donnelly and historian Daniel Diehl write that \"barns and homes were blessed to protect people and livestock from the effect of witches, who were believed to accompany the malignant spirits as they traveled the earth\"",

Despite earlier aspirations, her only film credits, Good Times and Chastity, were critical and commercial failures, and Hollywood did not take her seriously as an actress. Reflecting on this period, Cher said, \"I was dropped by my [label] and couldn't get a job ... [so] I went to Las Vegas\", which she likened to an \"elephant's graveyard\" for fading stars. Despite her success performing there, she felt unfulfilled: \"I was making a fortune ... but I was dying inside.\"\nIn 1982, Cher moved to New York to study acting with Lee Strasberg at the Actors Studio, but skipped enrollment after auditioning for and being cast in Robert Altman's Broadway production Come Back to the 5 & Dime, Jimmy Dean, Jimmy Dean. Co-starring with Karen Black and Sandy Dennis, she played a James Dean fan club member at a 20-year reunion, earning unexpectedly positive reviews. Frank Rich of The New York Times praised her \"cheery, ingratiating nonperformance\" as a refreshing contrast in a dull ensemble, suggesting the play needed more of her and less of her co-stars.

Development of the visual effects began in pre-production, under the supervision of VFX Legion co-founders James David Hattin and Nate Smalley. Their work for the film comprised 200 shots of matte and digital compositing effects, such as green screening, set extensions, superimposed practical stunt effects, camera transitions, computer-generated imagery (CGI), and rig removal. Maya, Nuke, Houdini, and Redshift were among the software used to handle rendering and animation tasks. VFX Legion was also present on set to critique the shoot and rectify problems with the filmmaking.\nOne of the special effect team's most complex assignments was rendering the stunt of a Grabber victim's violent retreat to the spiritual realm. VFX Legion supervisor Ken Johnson managed the scene's filming on set. VFX Legion then developed a digital model of the actor from a 3D scan animated with retopologized graphics and textures, allowing them to employ ragdoll physics for fluid movement. This was a labor-intensive process because the filmmakers wanted the movement of the digital model to project a loss of control, and the stunt's combined animation to be slow enough to show that the victim was being forced into a void. Another challenging sequence saw VFX Legion modify in-home tracking shots with CGI, which entailed altering the frame rate of footage to maintain a continuously steady speed.",
