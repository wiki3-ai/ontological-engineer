    "chunk_text":"In an interview with Wired magazine during the 2016 Republican National Convention, he said that while he \"was not the world's biggest Donald Trump fan\", he would vote for him, and that Trump's candidacy made Turning Point's mission more difficult. Kirk flipped to supporting Trump at the convention and spent the remainder of the campaign assisting with travel and media arrangements for Donald Trump Jr. In October 2016, Kirk participated in a Fox News event along with Trump Jr., Eric Trump, and Lara Trump that had a pro-Donald Trump tone.\nIn July 2019, Kirk became chairman of Students for Trump, which had been acquired by Turning Point Action. The unsuccessful effort of his youth mobilization campaign led TPUSA and the Trump campaign to blame each other for an overall decline in Trump's youth support. In April 2020, Matthew Rosenberg and Katie Rogers wrote in The New York Times that Kirk exemplifies \"walking the line between mainstream conservative opinion and outright disinformation\" and that \"with a powerful ally in the president's eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., Mr. Kirk both amplifies the president's message and helps shape it.\"",

He has described his upbringing as \"privileged\", saying, \"I never had to want for something, and yet I knew that was not in any way the reality for most New Yorkers.\" As a child, he was often present on his mother's film sets, where he was loved by members of the film crews, who variously referred to him as \"Z\", \"Zoru\", \"Fadoose\", and \"Nonstop Mamdani\".\nMamdani attended the Bank Street School for Children on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, where he successfully ran as the independent candidate in a middle school mock election, adopting a platform of \"equal rights, anti-war policies that proposed spending money on education rather than the military\". In 2003, he returned to Kampala for a year and attended school during his father's sabbatical there; his paternal grandparents and aunt still lived there and helped take care of him while his father was working on the book Good Muslim, Bad Muslim.\nIn 2010, Mamdani graduated from the Bronx High School of Science in Kingsbridge Heights, where he co-founded the school's first cricket team and unsuccessfully ran for student body vice president. He also played soccer with the West Side Soccer League. Mamdani then attended Bowdoin College in Brunswick, Maine, where he co-founded the school's chapter of Students for Justice in Palestine. He was a regular contributor to the campus newspaper The Bowdoin Orient, covering politics, culture, and sports via his column titled Kwame's Column",

Throughout the demonstrations, broadcasts by the Voice of America news outlet became a key source of information for student protesters.\nGeneral Secretary Hu Yaobang was blamed for showing a \"soft\" attitude and mishandling the protests, thus undermining social stability. He was denounced thoroughly by conservatives and was forced to resign as general secretary on 16 January 1987. The party began the \"Anti-bourgeois liberalisation campaign\", aiming at Hu, political liberalisation, and Western-inspired ideas in general. The campaign stopped student protests and restricted political activity, but Hu remained popular among intellectuals, students, and Communist Party progressives.",

    "chunk_text":"The visual effects for Wicked were made by Industrial Light & Magic and Framestore, with Pablo Helman serving as the production visual effects supervisor. On February 6, 2024, it was confirmed that post-production work was in progress, with Chu working remotely with editor Myron Kerstein and editing with the newly released Apple Vision Pro. Throughout editing, Kerstein felt emotionally connected to Wicked and its story, particularly during post-production work on the Ozdust Ballroom and \"Defying Gravity\" sequences. Reflecting on the former scene, he stated: \"We always felt like the Ozdust Ballroom was basically the set piece we had to get right, because if that didn't work, the rest of the movie was going to fall apart.\" The sequence involved watching the entireties of every ten-minute-long take of Elphaba and Glinda's dance duet and picking the right portions that provoked the most emotional response. Editing on the entire film was done through Avid Media Composer.\nWicked has 2,200 visual effects shots. Team Aspect handled the main-on-end title sequence and motion design, using 1930s stylization in homage to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer's film The Wizard of Oz (1939); this included a recreation of the Universal logo at the start, along with onscreen typography for the title and \"To be continued\" cards similar to the font used in The Wizard of Oz.",

    "chunk_text":"Each article and each user of Wikipedia has an associated and dedicated \"talk\" page. These form the primary communication channel for editors to discuss, coordinate and debate. Wikipedia's community has been described as cultlike, although not always with entirely negative connotations. Its preference for cohesiveness, even if it requires compromise that includes disregard of credentials, has been referred to as \"anti-elitism\".\n\nWikipedia does not require that its editors and contributors provide identification. As Wikipedia grew, \"Who writes Wikipedia?\" became one of the questions frequently asked there. Jimmy Wales once argued that only \"a community ... a dedicated group of a few hundred volunteers\" makes the bulk of contributions to Wikipedia and that the project is therefore \"much like any traditional organization\". Since Wikipedia relies on volunteer labour, editors frequently focus on topics that interest them.",

Articles depicting what some critics have called objectionable content (such as feces, cadaver, human penis, vulva, and nudity) contain graphic pictures and detailed information easily available to anyone with access to the internet, including children. The site also includes sexual content such as images and videos of masturbation and ejaculation, illustrations of zoophilia, and photos from hardcore pornographic films in its articles. It also has non-sexual photographs of nude children.\nThe Wikipedia article about Virgin Killer\u2014a 1976 album from the German rock band Scorpions\u2014features a picture of the album's original cover, which depicts a naked prepubescent girl. The original release cover caused controversy and was replaced in some countries. In December 2008, access to the Wikipedia article Virgin Killer was blocked for four days by most Internet service providers in the United Kingdom after the Internet Watch Foundation (IWF) decided the album cover was a potentially illegal indecent image and added the article's URL to a \"blacklist\" it supplies to British internet service providers.\nIn April 2010, Sanger wrote a letter to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, outlining his concerns that two categories of images on Wikimedia Commons contained child pornography, and were in violation of US federal obscenity law",

Along with Brent Hamachek, he co-wrote the 2016 book Time for a Turning Point: Setting a Course Toward Free Markets and Limited Government for Future Generations, which was published by Post Hill Press, a subsidiary of Simon & Schuster. Under the same publisher, Kirk wrote the 2018 book Campus Battlefield: How Conservatives Can WIN the Battle on Campus and Why It Matters. Donald Trump Jr. wrote the foreword for the book. In a review for The Weekly Standard, Adam Rubenstein described the book as a \"hot mess\", \"nothing more than a marketing pitch for TPUSA\", and said the \"thin\" book was \"stuffed with reprintings of his tweets and quotes from others\".\nIn 2020, Kirk wrote The MAGA Doctrine: The Only Ideas That Will Win the Future, which was published by Harper Collins. In its review for The New York Times, Gabriel Debenedetti wrote that \"Kirk's musing about whether 'The Art of The Deal' might one day be considered a 'religious tract' comes just nine chapters after the book highlights the importance of 'a healthy dose of skepticism about authority figures and experts who think they knew best.' And that's just pages after its dedication to Donald Trump, which is five chapters before Kirk wonders whether Trump might 'be remembered as the president who brought about world peace.'\" In Open Letters Review, Steve Donoghue said of the book that \"On every page, Kirk writes something that's either trivially, casually wrong ..",
