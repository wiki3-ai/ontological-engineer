    "Charles James  Kirk (October 14, 1993 – September 10, 2025) was an American right-wing political activist, entrepreneur, and media personality. He co‑founded the conservative student organization Turning Point USA (TPUSA) in 2012 and served as its executive director until his assassination in 2025. A key ally of Donald Trump, he became one of the most prominent voices of the MAGA movement within the Republican Party, publishing several books and hosting The Charlie Kirk Show.\n",
    "Born and raised in the Chicago suburbs of Arlington Heights and Prospect Heights, Kirk became politically active in high school. He briefly attended college before dropping out to focus on building TPUSA, which expanded into affiliate groups such as Turning Point Action and Turning Point Faith. His activism centered on mobilizing conservative students and promoting Republican causes nationwide.\n",
    "Kirk espoused a range of conservative positions, including opposition to abortion, gun control, diversity, equity, and inclusion programs, and LGBTQ rights. Over time, he aligned with the Christian right and advocated for Christian nationalism. His more controversial positions included criticism of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Martin Luther King Jr., as well as promotion of COVID-19 misinformation, false allegations of electoral fraud in 2020, and the white genocide conspiracy theory.\n",
    "On September 10, 2025, Kirk was shot and killed  while speaking at a TPUSA debate event at Utah Valley University\n"

    "Charles James Kirk was born on October 14, 1993, in the Chicago suburb of Arlington Heights, Illinois, and raised in nearby Prospect Heights. His father, Robert W. Kirk, is an architect who was involved in the construction of Trump Tower. His mother, Kathryn (née Smith), is a former trader at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange who subsequently worked as a mental health counselor. He had one sibling, a younger sister, Mary, who went on to become an art curator in Chicago.\n",
    "Kirk described his parents as moderate Republicans. They were active in conservative circles, and his father was a major donor to the Mitt Romney 2012 presidential campaign. Raised in the Presbyterian Church, Kirk was a member of the Boy Scouts of America and earned the rank of Eagle Scout. He experienced a political awakening in middle school, during which he read books by economist Milton Friedman and became more attracted to the principles of the Republican Party.\n",
    "In 2010, during his junior year at Wheeling High School, Kirk volunteered for the successful U.S. Senate campaign of Illinois Republican Mark Kirk (no relation). Also during his junior year, he began listening to The Rush Limbaugh Show, a prominent conservative talk radio broadcast. In his senior year, he initiated a boycott of cookies at the school's cafeteria to reverse a price increase\n"

Although he was accepted that same year to Baylor University in Waco, Texas, he enrolled instead at Harper College, a community college in Palatine, Illinois. Withdrawing after one semester, he left Harper to concentrate on his work with Turning Point USA, the political group he co-founded with conservative businessman and mentor Bill Montgomery. In 2015, Kirk enrolled part-time at King's College in New York City, taking online classes.

    "In May 2012, Kirk gave a speech at Benedictine University's \"Youth Government Day\", where he met Bill Montgomery, a 72-year-old retiree who was then a Tea Party–backed legislative candidate. Montgomery later said that the speakers at the event had bored the audience of a few hundred high-school kids, but they began to pay rapt attention when Kirk started speaking. Montgomery then encouraged Kirk to pursue political activism full-time. A month after they first met, Montgomery and Kirk co-founded Turning Point USA, wanting to start an organization rivaling liberal groups such as MoveOn.org. Kirk described it as a student organization advocating for free markets and limited government. At the 2012 Republican National Convention, Kirk met Foster Friess, a former investment manager and prominent Republican donor, and persuaded him to finance the organization.\n",
    "Kirk remained the executive director, chief fundraiser, and the public face of Turning Point USA until his death in 2025. He became known for visiting college campuses to debate with ideological opponents, typically students, and persuade them to consider conservative candidates. According to the Associated Press, video clips of Kirk's campus appearances spread online, helping him \"secure a steady stream of donations that transformed Turning Point into one of the country's largest political organizations\"\n"

    "TPUSA's activities include publication of the Professor Watchlist and the School Board Watchlist. Critics of these watchlists say they threaten academic freedom and have led to the targeted harassment of academics. In 2019, the Professor Watchlist was briefly suspended by its web host. In 2020, ProPublica investigated TPUSA's finances and found that the organization made \"misleading financial claims\", that the audits were not done by an independent auditor, and that the leaders had enriched themselves while advocating for Trump. ProPublica also reported that Kirk's salary from TPUSA had increased from $27,000 to nearly $300,000 and that he had bought an $855,000 condo in Longboat Key, Florida. In 2020, Turning Point USA had $39.2 million in revenue. Kirk earned a salary of more than $325,000 from TPUSA and related organizations.\n"

In July 2019, Kirk announced that Turning Point Action had acquired Students for Trump along with \"all associated media assets\". He became chairman and launched a campaign to mobilize the youth vote for the 2020 Trump reelection campaign. The unsuccessful effort led TPUSA and the 2020 Trump campaign to blame each other for an overall decline in Trump's youth support. In December 2022, Kirk announced the Mount Vernon Project, an initiative by Turning Point Action to remove members from the Republican National Committee who were not \"grassroot conservatives\".\n",
    "On January 5, 2021, the day before the Washington, D.C., protest that led to the January 6 U.S. Capitol attack, Kirk wrote on Twitter that Turning Point Action and Students for Trump were sending more than 80 \"buses of patriots to D.C. to fight for this president\". A spokesman for Turning Point said that the groups ended up sending seven buses, not 80, with 350 students. In the lead-up to the storming, Kirk said he was \"getting 500 emails a minute calling for a civil war\". Publix heiress Julie Fancelli gave Kirk's organizations $1.25 million to fund the buses to the January 6 event. Kirk also paid $60,000 for Kimberly Guilfoyle to speak at the rally.\n",

Students and alumni raised objections to the organization's aggressive political tone, which they considered inconsistent with the university's mission. Falwell resigned as president of Liberty University in August 2020, and the university did not renew Kirk's one-year contract in late 2020.

Kirk disagreed with critics that he created a toxic environment online, arguing: \"Disagreement is a healthy part of our systems.\" Kirk's positions have been described as far-right by a variety of outlets and academics, and others state that these positions are now in the mainstream of American conservatism.\n",

    "On March 3, 2020, Kirk released his book The MAGA Doctrine, a manifesto for the Make America Great Again (MAGA) movement, in which he wrote that the Republican Party is \"in some sense no longer a conservative party, no longer the party of Reagan, but instead a Trump-remade populist party\". At an August 2020 meeting of the Council for National Policy, Kirk said: \"Democrats have done a really foolish thing by shutting down all these campuses ... It's gonna remove ballot harvesting opportunities and all their voter fraud that they usually do on college campuses—so they're actually removing half a million votes off the table. So please keep the campuses closed—it's a great thing. Whatever!\" In December 2022, Kirk urged the Republican National Committee to listen to their grassroots voters, saying, \"If ignored, we will have the most stunted and muted Republican Party in the history of the conservative movement, the likes of which we haven't seen in generations.\" In 2023, Kirk called for the imprisonment or the death penalty of Joe Biden for \"crimes against America\".\n",
    "Kirk was an early investor in 1789 Capital, which invests in MAGA businesses. Trump Jr. joined 1789 Capital in November 2024, after Trump won the 2024 election. Before the 2024 U.S. presidential election, Kirk visited approximately 25 college campuses, marketed as the \"You're Being Brainwashed\" tour. His aim was to stir up more Gen Z voter turnout, and he engaged and debated students on many topics\n"

Kirk aided the president-elect in choosing leadership positions for his administration, including cabinet positions. During 2025, Kirk endorsed a number of Republican candidates, including Andy Biggs in the Arizona governor contest and Nate Morris in the Kentucky U.S. Senate primary. On July 15, 2025, Kirk conducted extensive interviews about Jeffrey Epstein on his podcast and pressured Trump's administration to release more information.

He promoted the Cultural Marxism conspiracy theory, and called universities \"islands of totalitarianism\". In a 2015 speech at the Liberty Forum of Silicon Valley, Kirk said he had applied for nomination to the U.S. Military Academy in West Point, New York, and was not accepted. He said that \"the slot he considered his went to 'a far less-qualified candidate of a different gender and a different persuasion'\" whose test scores he claimed he knew. He told The New Yorker in 2017 that he was being sarcastic when he said it. He told the Chicago Tribune in 2018 that \"he was just repeating something he'd been told\", while at a New Hampshire Turning Point event featuring Rand Paul in October 2019 he claimed he never said it.\n",
    "Kirk promoted debunked claims about George Floyd, such as that he was \"illegally counterfeiting currency\" and had once \"put a gun to a pregnant woman's stomach\". On Facebook, YouTube, and Rumble, Kirk repeatedly promoted the false claim that the medical examiner who performed the autopsy declared Floyd had died of an overdose. After a fact check by Agence France-Presse that noted the doctor stood by the classification of Floyd's death as a homicide, corrections were added to Kirk's posts on social media.\n",

He had said that guns, armed guards, and gun detectors could be used to prevent shootings in schools and campuses. In an April 2023 TPUSA event in Salt Lake City, Utah, Kirk said: \"I think it's worth it, I think it's worth to have a cost of, unfortunately, some gun deaths every single year so that we can have the Second Amendment to protect our other God-given rights.\"\n"

    "Kirk was relatively respectful regarding LGBTQ rights by supporting secularism in 2018, but by 2022 had reversed his positions, routinely making anti-LGBTQ remarks and opposing transgender rights and medical care. On November 22, 2019, Kirk said, \"I believe marriage is one man, one woman\", but added that gay people should be allowed in the conservative movement. In 2022, during an episode of The Charlie Kirk Show streamed on YouTube, Kirk criticized the Supreme Court's decision in Obergefell v. Hodges. He called LGBTQ activists the \"alphabet mafia\", claiming that the movement is not \"just about two dudes being able to get married\". Kirk called Obergefell a \"national takeover of our laws\" and argued that conservatives mistakenly thought the issue of same-sex marriage in the United States would end after the ruling, instead concluding that \"they are not happy just having marriage\" and \"want to corrupt your children\".\n",
    "In the op-ed \"Sexual Anarchy\" for The American Mind on October 14, 2021, Kirk said \"the facts are that there are only two genders; that transgenderism and gender 'fluidity' are lies that hurt people and abuse kids.\" In early 2023, he said that transgender women in women's locker rooms should be \"taken care of the way we used to take care of things in the 1950s and '60s\"\n"

In another 2023 speech, Kirk said, \"One issue I think that is so against our senses, so against the natural law and dare I say a throbbing middle finger to God, is the transgender thing happening in America right now.\" In the same speech, he quoted a Bible verse saying that a man wearing women's clothes or a woman wearing men's clothes is an \"abomination\". On April 1, 2024, Kirk called for Trump to propose a nationwide ban of gender-affirming care for transgender people. That same day, he called for the imprisonment of doctors who perform gender-affirming care and demanded \"Nuremberg-style\" trials for them. He also promoted misinformation about violence by transgender people.\n",
    "Kirk routinely asserted that there is an \"LGBTQ agenda\". On the June 8, 2024, episode of his podcast, he criticized YouTuber Ms. Rachel for a post that celebrated Pride Month by quoting the Bible verse \"love thy neighbor,\" arguing that she was being selective. Kirk told Ms. Rachel \"you might want to crack open that Bible of yours, in a lesser reference — part of the same part of scripture is in Leviticus 18, is that thou shall lay with another man shall be stoned to death. Just saying. So, Ms. Rachel, you quote Leviticus 19, love your neighbor as yourself. The chapter before affirms God's perfect law when it comes to sexual matters.\" In the same podcast episode, he called being gay an \"error\" and likened the LGBTQ pride movement to encouraging drug addicts\n"

Following social media backlash, he released a statement on the website of the Claremont Institute reiterating and expanding his remarks. According to Media Matters for America, Kirk said at the TPUSA Young Women's Leadership Summit 2022 Conference that the \"biblical model\" for women to pursue in romantic relationships is a partner who is \"a protector and a leader, and deep down, a vast majority of you agree\" and that \"if you want to go meet conservative men that have their act together, that aren't like, woke beta men, like, start a Turning Point USA chapter, you'll meet a lot of them.\" Kirk had repeatedly criticized birth control, and once said that it creates \"very angry and bitter young ladies and young women\".\n"

    "Kirk was a critic of schools and local governments teaching about racism. He wrote in a 2021 Fox News article that \"directly confronting the left, and promising to fight their illiberal ideology with state power when necessary, is the key to winning everyday Americans\". He served on Trump's 1776 Commission to advance \"patriotic education\", which was set up in response to the 1619 Project. In October 2021, Kirk began the \"Exposing Critical Racism Tour\" of a number of campuses and off-campus venues to \"fight racist theories on America's college campuses!\" He also opposed Juneteenth (a day which commemorates the end of slavery in the U.S.) being declared a federal holiday, describing it as \"anti-American\" for promoting \"a neo-segregationist view\" that he alleged sought to supplant Independence Day.\n",

I may have been admitted on affirmative action, both in terms of being a woman and a woman of color, but I can declare that I did not graduate on affirmative action.\" Kirk reacted to this on his podcast on July 13, 2023, by stating \"If we would have said three weeks ago [...] that Joy Reid and Michelle Obama and Sheila Jackson Lee and Ketanji Brown Jackson were affirmative-action picks, we would have been called racist. But now they're comin' out and they're saying it for us!\" He continued, \"You do not have the brain processing power to otherwise be taken really seriously.

Responding to accusations by Malcolm Kenyatta that he was working to undermine King and the Voting Rights Act of 1965, Kirk called this claim \"a lie\" and \"fear-mongering\", and added that telling the \"truth\" about King \"should not be trampling sacred ground\" since he was \"just a man ... a very flawed one at that\" and a \"mythological anti-racist creation of the 1960s\". Kirk later said he had \"found the sacred cow of modern America\" in criticizing King\n"

On the topic of the former, Kirk stated that \"America does not need more visas for people from India\", arguing that the American workforce has become dominated by Indian-American immigrants effectively decreasing job opportunities for Americans. On the topic of the latter, Kirk commented on how race is less important to culture than religion is, stating that America would still be America if it were ethnically 90% Indian, as long as they were Christian Indians.\n",
    "Kirk elaborated on Hinduism and his disapproval of its morality due to its polytheism, stating: \"When you have multiple gods, you get different moralities. And the West has largely embraced the idea that there is a standard of conduct, or a best way to live.\" Furthermore, in reply to an inquiry about how that claim was not inclusive of other religious worldviews, he responded: \"I don't seek to be inclusive, I seek what his best. And the Ten Commandments are what is best. Would it be offensive to a young Hindu kid? Maybe, maybe not. But it also is a reminder they're living in a country that's a monotheistic country.\"\n"

Kirk called for the use of force against migrants at the U.S.–Mexico border, including the use of tear gas, rubber bullets and whips. Kirk said that migrants were \"bringing force upon themselves\" by \"invading\" the country. In justifying this use of force, Kirk promoted false claims of disproportionate criminality among migrants, saying: \"Those are the men that will go into your communities and break into your homes and rape your women, take your children. But, hey, they're – they're dreamers.\"\n",

    "After Elon Musk endorsed a post which said that \"Jewish communities have been pushing the exact kind of hatred against whites that they claim to want people to stop using against them,\" Kirk defended Musk from charges of antisemitism by claiming the post's charge against Jewish communities was accurate. He went on to claim \"the philosophical foundation of anti-whiteness has been largely financed by Jewish donors\", but said he was glad that some donors were reconsidering. \n",

    "Kirk opposed the 2016 Paris Agreement on climate change. Kirk promoted climate change denial, calling global warming a hoax. In 2017, Kirk admitted that TPUSA had accepted funding from the fossil fuel industry. He spoke out against targeting fossil fuels and opposed student campaigns that pressured universities to divest from fossil fuels. In 2021, a Turning Point USA video featuring Kirk and Candace Owens claimed there is \"no factual data to back up global warming\" and that scientists do not know the cause; Science Feedback rated the claims inaccurate. Kirk later issued a correction and the video was removed. In 2022, Kirk warned that climate activism would erode American sovereignty and private property, describing it as a Trojan Horse for Marxism and likening it to \"pseudo-paganism\". He called the statement that climate change is an existential threat \"complete gibberish nonsense\", stating that if your biggest worry in life is existential, you have a great life, and added that he did not believe human activity is the driver of climate change.\n"

    "Kirk was an evangelical Christian, belonging to the Calvary Chapel Association. Prior to the early 2020s, Kirk was described as secular and a critic of religious influence on politics and the state. He later became a Christian nationalist. In 2021, Kirk partnered with California pastor Rob McCoy to launch TPUSA Faith to mobilize conservative Christians to vote Republican. Kirk's shift was influenced by events such as Trump's move of the American embassy in Israel to Jerusalem and COVID-era church closures, which he and his allies portrayed as religious persecution. In January 2025 he said that he had been keeping a \"Jewish sabbath\" since 2021, turning off his phone from Friday night to Saturday night, considering it to be a Christian commandment.\n",
    "Kirk advocated Christian creationism, arguing that evolution is false and that Charles Darwin has been debunked. He has discussed with Randy Guliuzza, the president of the Institute for Creation Research, ICR's support for Young Earth Creationism on his podcast. Kirk's YouTube page includes footage of debate on this topic at his signature \"Prove Me Wrong\" table on campus. Speaking on a podcast episode with creationist Stephen Meyer, Kirk said he was intrigued by Meyer's argument that there was scientific confirmation for intelligent design, contrary to Darwin.\n"

    "Far-right activists such as Laura Loomer called for violence and retaliation in the aftermath of Kirk's assassination, and doxxed people they accused of celebrating or justifying Kirk's death. Right-wing activists and members of the Trump administration's initial demands—that people allegedly celebrating Kirk's death be silenced and fired—soon evolved into a campaign to punish people who expressed criticism of Kirk. The administration's involvement led to comparisons with McCarthyism and cancel culture; The New York Times called it \"a conservative version of the cancel culture that only a few years ago was wielded by the American left\", and said it was evidence of the rise of a \"woke right\". A USA Today analysis showed that by September 18 more than 100 people—including lawyers, doctors, first responders, and more than 50 high school teachers and college professors—had been censured, suspended, dismissed, or were under investigation. In response to the conservative and government campaign to silence critics of Kirk, especially following the suspension of comedian Jimmy Kimmel's show, various commentators and publications discussed the issues of cancel culture and free speech in the United States in the aftermath of Kirk's death, including among others Tucker Carlson, The Guardian, NBC News, Reuters, and USA Today\n"

On September 13, the mayor of the city of Netanya, Israel, announced that a traffic circle in the city would be renamed in honor of Kirk. At Kirk's memorial service on September 21, Hillsdale College president Larry P. Arnn announced that he would be posthumously awarded an honorary degree.

    "Kirk was the author of several books. Along with Brent Hamachek, he co-wrote the 2016 book Time for a Turning Point: Setting a Course Toward Free Markets and Limited Government for Future Generations, which was published by Post Hill Press, a subsidiary of Simon & Schuster. Under the same publisher, Kirk wrote the 2018 book Campus Battlefield: How Conservatives Can WIN the Battle on Campus and Why It Matters. Donald Trump Jr. wrote the foreword for the book. In a review for The Weekly Standard, Adam Rubenstein described the book as a \"hot mess\", \"nothing more than a marketing pitch for TPUSA\", and said the \"thin\" book was \"stuffed with reprintings of his tweets and quotes from others\".\n",
    "In 2020, Kirk wrote The MAGA Doctrine: The Only Ideas That Will Win the Future, which was published by Harper Collins. In its review for The New York Times, Gabriel Debenedetti wrote that \"Kirk's musing about whether 'The Art of The Deal' might one day be considered a 'religious tract' comes just nine chapters after the book highlights the importance of 'a healthy dose of skepticism about authority figures and experts who think they knew best.' And that's just pages after its dedication to Donald Trump, which is five chapters before Kirk wonders whether Trump might 'be remembered as the president who brought about world peace.'\" In Open Letters Review, Steve Donoghue said of the book that \"On every page, Kirk writes something that's either trivially, casually wrong ..\n"
