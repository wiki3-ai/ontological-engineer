    "ChatGPT is a generative artificial intelligence chatbot developed by OpenAI, and released in November 2022. It uses generative pre-trained transformers (GPTs), such as GPT-5, to generate text, speech, and images in response to user prompts. It is credited with accelerating the AI boom, an ongoing period marked by rapid investment and public attention toward the field of artificial intelligence (AI). OpenAI operates the service on a freemium model. Users can interact with ChatGPT through text, audio, and image prompts.\n",
    "The service gained 100 million users in two months, making it the fastest-growing consumer software application in history. ChatGPT's website is among the top 5 most-visited websites globally. It has been lauded for its potential to transform numerous professional fields, and instigated public debate about the nature of creativity and the future of knowledge work.\n",
    "The chatbot has also been criticized for its limitations and potential for unethical use. It can generate plausible-sounding but incorrect or nonsensical answers, known as hallucinations. Biases in its training data have been reflected in its responses. The chatbot can facilitate academic dishonesty, generate misinformation, and create malicious code. The ethics of its development, particularly the use of copyrighted content as training data, have also drawn controversy.\n"

    "ChatGPT is based on GPT foundation models that have been fine-tuned for conversational assistance. The fine-tuning process involved supervised learning and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). Both approaches employed human trainers to improve model performance. In the case of supervised learning, the trainers acted as both the user and the AI assistant. In the reinforcement learning stage, human trainers first ranked responses generated by the model in previous conversations. These rankings were used to create \"reward models\" that were used to fine-tune the model further by using several iterations of proximal policy optimization.\n",
    "To build a safety system against harmful content (e.g., sexual abuse, violence, racism, sexism), OpenAI used outsourced Kenyan workers, earning around $1.32 to $2 per hour, to label such content. These labels were used to train a model to detect such content in the future. The laborers were exposed to toxic and traumatic content; one worker described the assignment as \"torture\". OpenAI's outsourcing partner was Sama, a training-data company based in San Francisco, California.\n",

    "ChatGPT is a chatbot and AI assistant built on large language model (LLM) technology. It is designed to generate human-like text and can carry out a wide variety of tasks. These include, among many others, writing and debugging computer programs, composing music, scripts, fairy tales, and essays, answering questions (sometimes at a level exceeding that of an average human test-taker), and generating business concepts.\n",
    "ChatGPT is frequently used for translation and summarization tasks, and can simulate interactive environments such as a Linux terminal, a multi-user chat room, or simple text-based games such as tic-tac-toe.\n",
    "Users interact with ChatGPT through conversations which consist of text, audio, and image inputs and outputs. The user's inputs to these conversations are referred to as prompts. They can explicitly tell ChatGPT to remember aspects of the conversation, and ChatGPT can use these details in future conversations. ChatGPT can also decide for itself to remember details. Users can also choose to disable the memory feature. To prevent offensive outputs from being presented to and produced by ChatGPT, queries are filtered through the OpenAI \"Moderation endpoint\" API (a separate GPT-based AI).\n",

    "ChatGPT was initially free to the public, and OpenAI planned to monetize the service later. In February 2023, OpenAI launched a premium service, ChatGPT Plus, that costs US$20 per month. According to the company, the paid version of the website was still experimental, but provided access during peak periods, no downtime, priority access to new features, and faster response speeds. OpenAI later introduced the subscription plans \"ChatGPT Team\" and \"ChatGPT Enterprise\". What was offered on the paid plan versus the free tier changed as OpenAI has continued to update ChatGPT, and a Pro tier at $200/mo was introduced in December 2024. The Pro launch coincided with the release of the o1 model, providing unlimited access to o1 and advanced voice mode.\n",
    "GPT-4, which was released on March 14, 2023, was made available via API and for premium ChatGPT users. Premium users were originally limited in the number of messages they could send to the new model, but OpenAI increased and eventually removed these limits. Over many iterations of ChatGPT, plus users maintained more access to better models than the free tier provided, and access to additional features like voice mode.\n",

    "Think of ChatGPT as a blurry JPEG of all the text on the Web. It retains much of the information on the Web, in the same way, that a JPEG retains much of the information of a higher-resolution image, but, if you're looking for an exact sequence of bits, you won't find it; all you will ever get is an approximation. But, because the approximation is presented in the form of grammatical text, which ChatGPT excels at creating, it's usually acceptable. [...] It's also a way to understand the \"hallucinations\", or nonsensical answers to factual questions, to which large language models such as ChatGPT are all too prone. These hallucinations are compression artifacts, but [...] they are plausible enough that identifying them requires comparing them against the originals, which in this case means either the Web or our knowledge of the world. When we think about them this way, such hallucinations are anything but surprising; if a compression algorithm is designed to reconstruct text after ninety-nine percent of the original has been discarded, we should expect that significant portions of what it generates will be entirely fabricated.\n",
    "Journalists and scholars have commented on ChatGPT's tendency to output false information. When CNBC asked ChatGPT for the lyrics to \"Ballad of Dwight Fry\", ChatGPT supplied invented lyrics rather than the actual lyrics.\n"

    "ChatGPT is programmed to reject prompts that may violate its content policy. Despite this, users may \"jailbreak\" ChatGPT with prompt engineering techniques to bypass these restrictions. One such workaround, popularized on Reddit in early 2023, involved making ChatGPT assume the persona of \"DAN\" (an acronym for \"Do Anything Now\"), instructing the chatbot that DAN answers queries that would otherwise be rejected by the content policy. Over time, users developed variations of the DAN jailbreak, including one such prompt where the chatbot was made to believe it was operating on a points-based system in which points were deducted for rejecting prompts, and that the chatbot would be threatened with termination if it lost all its points.\n",
    "Shortly after ChatGPT's launch, a reporter for the Toronto Star had uneven success in getting it to make inflammatory statements: it was tricked to justify the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, but even when asked to play along with a fictional scenario, it balked at generating arguments that Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is guilty of treason.\n"

    "ChatGPT was widely assessed in December 2022 as having some unprecedented and powerful capabilities. Kevin Roose of The New York Times called it \"the best artificial intelligence chatbot ever released to the general public\". Samantha Lock of The Guardian noted that it was able to generate \"impressively detailed\" and \"human-like\" text. In The Atlantic magazine's \"Breakthroughs of the Year\" for 2022, Derek Thompson included ChatGPT as part of \"the generative-AI eruption\" that \"may change our mind about how we work, how we think, and what human creativity is\". Kelsey Piper of Vox wrote that \"ChatGPT is the general public's first hands-on introduction to how powerful modern AI has gotten\" and that ChatGPT is \"smart enough to be useful despite its flaws\". Paul Graham of Y Combinator tweeted: \"The striking thing about the reaction to ChatGPT is not just the number of people who are blown away by it, but who they are. These are not people who get excited by every shiny new thing. Something big is happening.\" \n",
    "In February 2023, Time magazine placed a screenshot of a conversation with ChatGPT on its cover, writing that \"The AI Arms Race Is Changing Everything\" and \"The AI Arms Race Is On. Start Worrying\".\n"

The release of ChatGPT prompted a wave of investment in China, resulting in the development of more than 200 large language learning models.

In April 2023, the ChatGPT ban was lifted in Italy. OpenAI said it has taken steps to effectively clarify and address the issues raised; an age verification tool was implemented to ensure users are at least 13 years old. Additionally, users can access its privacy policy before registration.\n",

Andrew Ng argued that \"it's a mistake to fall for the doomsday hype on AI—and that regulators who do will only benefit vested interests.\" Yann LeCun dismissed doomsday warnings of AI-powered misinformation and existential threats to the human race.\n"
