    "One Battle After Another is a 2025 American black comedy action thriller film written, directed, and co-produced by Paul Thomas Anderson. It stars Leonardo DiCaprio, Sean Penn, Benicio del Toro, Regina Hall, Teyana Taylor, and Chase Infiniti. Inspired by Thomas Pynchon's novel Vineland (1990), the film follows an ex-revolutionary who is forced back into his former combative lifestyle when he and his daughter are pursued by a corrupt military officer.\n",
    "Anderson had wanted to adapt Vineland for years and, eventually, incorporated several of his own stories into the narrative while writing the screenplay. The film was shot in California using VistaVision, becoming one of the first films to use this format for principal photography since the 1960s.\n",
    "One Battle After Another had its world premiere in Los Angeles on September 8, 2025, and was theatrically released in the United States by Warner Bros. Pictures on September 26. The most expensive film of Anderson's career, One Battle After Another received widespread critical acclaim, grossing $205.1 million on a $130–175 million budget and becoming the highest-grossing film of Anderson's career. One Battle After Another was nominated for nine awards at the 83rd Golden Globe Awards, receiving the most nominations of any film that year.\n"

    "\"Ghetto\" Pat Calhoun and Perfidia Beverly Hills are members of a far-left revolutionary group, the French 75. While breaking out detained immigrants from Otay Mesa Detention Center, Perfidia sexually humiliates the commanding officer, Steven J. Lockjaw, who afterward becomes obsessed with her. Pat and Perfidia become lovers. When Lockjaw catches Perfidia planting a bomb, he releases her after she agrees to his demand to have sex with him.\n",
    "After Perfidia gives birth to a girl named Charlene, Pat tries to persuade her to settle down, but she instead abandons Pat and Charlene to continue her revolutionary activities. She is caught after murdering a security guard in an armed bank robbery. Lockjaw arranges for her to avoid prison in exchange for names and whereabouts of key French 75 members. Perfidia enters witness protection while Lockjaw uses the information she provided to hunt down and summarily execute her comrades. French 75 member Howard gives Pat and Charlene stolen identities as Bob and Willa Ferguson, while Perfidia leaves witness protection for Mexico.\n",
    "Sixteen years later, living off-the-grid in the sanctuary city of Baktan Cross, California, Bob has become a paranoid stoner. He is protective of Willa, now a free-spirited teenager who resents his substance abuse, and has led her to believe Perfidia was a hero. Through his vehement anti-immigration efforts, Lockjaw has become a colonel and a prominent figure within the US security agencies\n"

When Lockjaw is invited to become a member of the Christmas Adventurers Club, a white supremacist secret society, he seeks to kill Willa to hide his past interracial relationship with Perfidia. He hires the Indigenous bounty hunter Avanti Q to capture Howard, causing a distress signal to go out to the French 75.\n",
    "Lockjaw sends troops to Baktan Cross using an immigration and drug operation as cover. French 75 member Deandra rescues Willa before her school dance is raided. High at home, Bob is warned by the French 75 about Lockjaw, whose men then raid his house. Escaping through a tunnel, Bob tries to coordinate with the resistance over a payphone but cannot remember their greeting code. Sergio St. Carlos, Willa's karate teacher and community leader, helps him while evacuating immigrants via a hidden passage. While fleeing with Sergio's students across rooftops, Bob falls and is arrested. Deandra takes Willa to a convent of revolutionary nuns, where she is told the truth about her mother's betrayal of the cause.\n",
    "The Christmas Adventurers find evidence of Lockjaw's relationship with Perfidia and send member Tim Smith to kill him and Willa. Lockjaw locates Willa at the convent, where Deandra is arrested. Holding Willa hostage, he tests their DNA in front of her, confirming she is his daughter. Sergio arranges Bob's escape and drives him to the convent, throwing him out of the car when police begin to pursue them\n"

Lockjaw hires Avanti to kill Willa, but after refusing over her age, Avanti is told to deliver her to a far-right militia instead. Tim tracks down Lockjaw and shoots him in the face, causing his car to crash and leaving him presumed dead. Bob finds the crash site while searching for Willa.\n",
    "Avanti brings Willa to the militia but, after a change of heart, frees her and is killed in a shootout with the militia. Willa takes Avanti's car and pistol and escapes, only for Tim to begin tailing her with Bob frantically trying to catch up. Willa lures Tim into a crash by exploiting a blind summit. She shoots him dead when he fails to recite the revolutionary countersign. Bob arrives and finds Willa. Willa demands the countersign at gunpoint, but Bob convinces her to stand down. They tearfully embrace and drive away, and Lockjaw is revealed to have survived.\n",
    "Some time later, a severely scarred Lockjaw is seemingly welcomed into the Christmas Adventurers but is fatally gassed and cremated shortly afterwards. Returning home with Willa, Bob gives her a letter from Perfidia, where she apologizes for her actions and vows to reunite with her family soon. Later, Bob gives Willa his blessing as she departs for a protest in Oakland.\n"

    "Anderson had considered adapting Thomas Pynchon's novel Vineland (1990) for years, but struggled, believing his love for the novel would get in the way of his ability to fairly rework it. Instead, he set aside the idea of an adaptation, and wrote a series of separate stories. One Battle After Another emerged as a combination of those stories with some elements of Vineland, particularly the father-daughter dynamic.\n",
    "In June 2023, Anderson's next film, rumored to star Leonardo DiCaprio, Regina Hall, Viggo Mortensen, and Joaquin Phoenix, found its home at Warner Bros. Pictures. In January 2024 DiCaprio and Hall were confirmed to star, with Sean Penn joining the cast. In February, Alana Haim, Wood Harris, Teyana Taylor, Shayna McHayle, and Chase Infiniti joined the cast. DiCaprio reportedly received his standard $25 million fee for his involvement.\n"

    "Principal photography began in California on January 22, 2024. The film, under the working title BC Project, filmed for eleven days across Humboldt County in Arcata, Cutten, Eureka, Kneeland and Trinidad. Local experts, including the Sisters of the Valley, on which the Sisters of the Brave Beaver in the film was based, were consulted. Anderson and his crew attended the prom at Eureka High School to make observations about music and fashion trends; students were cast as extras for a key scene. On February 3, production moved to Sacramento, with filming at the Sacramento County Administration Building and Sacramento County Courthouse. A homeless encampment was cleared to allow for filming, sparking controversy. The former Sacramento mansion of then governor Ronald Reagan served as exterior shots for the Christmas Adventurers' Club headquarters.\n",
    "The production took a two-and-a-half-month break from filming because del Toro had a scheduling conflict with Wes Anderson's The Phoenician Scheme (shot between March and June 2024). On-location filming also took place in Anza-Borrego Desert State Park and Borrego Springs in May 2024, and El Paso, Texas, in June 2024. Other filming locations included La Purísima Mission, the Westgate Hotel, the city of San Diego and Otay Mesa near the Mexico–United States border.\n",

    "In February 2024, Variety reported that the film had been greenlit with a $115 million production budget. In August 2024, The Wall Street Journal reported the budget was \"more than $140 million\", noting that Anderson's highest-grossing film, There Will Be Blood (2007), only made $76 million, but that \"Warner executives say DiCaprio's box-office track record justifies the budget for Anderson\". That month, sources indicated the film had been titled The Battle of Baktan Cross as rumors circulated that it was loosely inspired by Pynchon's Vineland; Anderson previously adapted Pynchon's Inherent Vice (2009) into a feature film in 2014. By August 2025, Variety reported the film's final budget as $175 million, while Warner Bros. said it cost $130 million. The film is the most costly of Anderson's career. Deadline Hollywood reported that below-the-line, on-location shooting in California cost $101.6 million, with a tax credit of $8.4 million.\n",
    "Beginning in January 2025, the film had multiple test screenings, which reinforced the rumored connection to Vineland. It marked the first time since Boogie Nights (1997) that Anderson agreed to audience testing; based on the feedback, he cut eight to ten minutes. The film's title was confirmed in March, with Warner Bros. debuting a teaser\n"

    "On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 95% of 420 critics' reviews are positive. The website's consensus reads: \"An epic screwball adventure teeming with awe-inspiring action set pieces, One Battle After Another is Paul Thomas Anderson's most entertaining film yet while also one of his most thematically rich.\" Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 95 out of 100, based on 63 critics, indicating \"universal acclaim\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A\" on its A+ to F scale, while those at PostTrak rated the film four-and-a-half out of five stars, with 74% of audiences saying they would \"definitely recommend\" it.\n",
    "Brian Tallerico of RogerEbert.com wrote that One Battle After Another \"is a timeless story of resistance, one that playfully weaves together influences as broad-reaching as the true story of Weather Underground and cinematic depictions of rebellion, but it's also a remarkably propulsive, fun, and eventually moving piece of work about the human beings caught up in the chaotic machine\". Justin Chang of The New Yorker called the film \"a father-daughter epic, with an unusually personal gush of feeling. You can count on one hand the number of scenes that Bob and Willa share, but their connection—a swirl of protectiveness, exasperation, and fiercely unconditional love—binds the movie and its madly whirling parts together\"\n"

    "Writing for The New York Times, Manohla Dargis called the film \"a carnivalesque epic about good and evil, violence and power, inalienable rights and the fight against injustice; it's also a love story. The film speaks to the failures of the past and of the present but insists on the promise of the future\". Richard Lawson of The Hollywood Reporter stated One Battle After Another is \"a furious film, a richly engaging and persuasive polemic\" in which \"Anderson shows a previously unseen aptitude for action and suspense; One Battle After Another is, essentially, a thriller, albeit one teeming with enormous ideas about the collapse and possible rescue of the country\". Alex Saveliev of Film Threat opened his review by writing that the film \"demands to be seen on the largest screen possible to fully absorb the 35mm VistaVision experience with every cell of your body. Everything about it is grand: its characters, its action sequences, its timely sentiments, even the quieter moments\".\n",

He celebrated the \"riff on the now recognisable Anderson-Pynchonian idea of counterculture and counter-revolution\", praised the score by Jonny Greenwood, and pondered if the \"central paternity crisis triangle [is] an image for an ownership dispute around the American melting-pot dream?\" Bradshaw awarded the film five stars.

    "The performances of the cast were highly praised. Owen Gleiberman of Variety wrote: \"Anderson knows that the quality that liberates DiCaprio is comedy.

David Sims of The Atlantic opined: \"Penn, giving a brilliant performance of cold villainy that could win him a third Oscar, is unafraid of lancing the inherent goofiness of a fascist\n"

    ". DiCaprio plays Bob as a sweetheart rather than a buffoon; he's a tired, strung-out antihero made weary not by his yearslong efforts to fight back but by the relentlessness of the world.\" David Ehrlich of IndieWire praised \"magnetically self-possessed newcomer/instant movie star Chase Infiniti, whose performance inspires a strange kind of secondhand pride\". He also singled out the performances of Taylor and Penn, calling the former \"eruptive [...] steaming with revolutionary zeal\" and the latter \"career-best\".\n",
    "William Bibbiani of TheWrap was less enthusiastic, describing the plot as scattershot, unfocused, overly long, and the film's themes as shallow, writing: \"[Anderson] is more interested in taking cheap potshots at the film's real-world analogues than actually exploring them.\" Kyle Smith of The Wall Street Journal similarly noted the film is \"big and brash. Rangy in tone, style and theme, it has so much going on that a single viewing hardly seems sufficient to absorb it all. Whether it's a masterpiece or a hodgepodge will be a matter of some discussion; the reach is evident but the grasp is a little shaky\"\n"

Fear also highlighted the performances of Penn and Taylor in his list of the \"17 Best Movie Performances of 2025\".
