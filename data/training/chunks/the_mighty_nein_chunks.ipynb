    "The Mighty Nein is set on Exandria, a fictional world created by Matthew Mercer in 2012 for his personal Dungeons & Dragons campaign which later launched as the actual play web series Critical Role in 2015. The story takes place on the continent of Wildemount, which is located to the east of Tal'Dorei, the setting of The Legend of Vox Machina (2022). It takes place 20 years after the events of The Legend of Vox Machina, at a time of very high tensions between the Dwendalian Empire and the Kryn Dynasty—two of Wildemount's major powers, which are divided by the Ashkeeper Peaks mountain range—and war is imminent.\n",
    "Western Wildemount is governed by the Dwendalian Empire and is ruled by King Bertrand Dwendal. A council of powerful archmages called the Cerberus Assembly act as advisors to the House of Dwendal. Trent Ikithon, Archmage of Civic Influence, controls a secret group of wizard assassins known as the Volstrucker. The Empire regards the region of Xhorhas, which occupies the eastern side of the continent, as an inhospitable wasteland. Xhorhas is governed by the Kryn Dynasty, is ruled by the Bright Queen Leylas Kryn, and is primarily home to the drow and other races considered to be monstrous. The Menagerie Coast occupies the southwestern coastline next to the Lucidian Ocean and is governed by the Clovis Concord, a coalition of city-states that includes Nicodranas and Port Damali.\n"

In a June 8, 2024 post on X; it was revealed that voice acting had begun. In a October 2024 interview, cast member and executive producer Travis Willingham stated that the writing for the first season was completed and that progress on the show was \"definitely more than halfway done\". In June 2025, Willingham stated that they had \"recorded the entire first and second season\".\n",
    "The cast were involved in the character design process. Cast member and executive producer Sam Riegel commented that The Mighty Nein will be \"tonally different\" from their first animated adaptation The Legend of Vox Machina. Showrunner and executive producer Tasha Huo similarly stated that the Mighty Nein \"reflects a more mature, more elevated storytelling\" than the previous series and this show has \"more drama\" and \"more filmmaking involved\". Huo noted that they tried \"to treat the show like a live-action show, which is tonally different than Vox Machina, but still keeping within the same world\". Willingham explained that this adaptation \"is from the get-go a complete departure\" and that \"you're coming into the characters that you love, but a totally new story\". Among the changes are the deaths of characters who survived in the original campaign, a deliberate decision by the creators to establish a darker tone for the series\n"

    ". In an October 2025 interview with Polygon, Willingham explained that The Mighty Nein would be slower paced than the first two seasons of The Legend of Vox Machina – comparing the approach to the new show to \"starting from a session zero perspective.\"\n",
    "Entertainment Weekly highlighted that The Mighty Nein will take a similar approach to the character Essek Thelyss as The Legend of Vox Machina series did with its \"more nefarious characters\", such as the Briarwoods, by \"showing story material that happened 'off screen' (metaphorically speaking, since there are no screens in a table-top campaign)\". Willingham commented that this approach will show the audience \"the machinations both happening in the Empire and the Dynasty, all the things moving behind the scenes, and really who was Essek\" and how he ended up \"in the place where he was, moving these large pieces and affecting a large portion of the world in The Mighty Nein\".\n"

    "The series is animated by Titmouse, Inc. Huo emphasized the appearance of spellcasting is unique for each character, reflecting \"who they are as people\". Dunamancy, a type of magic created by Mercer for the Kryn Dynasty, will also be featured. In comparison to The Legend of Vox Machina, Riegel noted that magic is more \"intricate\", highlighting that the components and incantations used \"to make magic\" as well as \"the way that people learn magic or are granted magic is a big, big deal in The Mighty Nein\". At the SCAD AnimationFest, art director Joseph Martinez explained that while the first series is \"a bit more high fantasy\", the setting for The Mighty Nein \"is more grounded and based on Eastern European history. We went for a more brutalist look, with architecture that over encumbers our characters\". The art design used deliberate \"color cues\" to signal \"unspoken political tensions\" and the characters' \"state of mind\".\n"
