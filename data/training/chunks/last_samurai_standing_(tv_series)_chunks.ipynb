    "During the Meiji era (late 19th century), 292 fighters come together at Tenryū-ji Temple in Kyoto, drawn by the chance to win a grand prize of ¥100,000. The challenge is clear: take each other's wooden tags and make it all the way to Tokyo. The winner takes the prize. One of the warriors, Shujiro Saga, joins the dangerous contest with a personal mission: to help his sick wife and child.\n"

    "Netflix announced the production of a \"Last Samurai Standing\" series, starring Junichi Okada, who is also  producer and action choreographer. Michihito Fujii and Kento Yamaguchi are its writer and director, produced by Office Shirous. About his multi-role in the drama, Okada said:\n",
    "\n",
    "When Netflix executive producer Mr. Takahashi reached out to me, I was still acting in historical dramas. Back then, I was already thinking of ways to make this genre a hit, not just in Japan, but all over the world. I saw their potential for action, drama, social commentary, and entertainment, but I knew they could be taken further. That’s when I came across Imamura’s novel. It was written in a way that modern audiences could enjoy, and I was excited about the idea of adapting it.\n",
    "The adaption of the novel into a multi-episode drama series involved significant creative challenges for the directors Michihito Fujii and Junichi Okada, it was like producing three feature-length films. They worked carefully to preserve the original story’s core themes, while enhancing its visual and dramatic appeal. The production featured nearly 300 actors, each requiring his own costume, which demanded consistent coordination and commitment from the entire crew.\n",
    "A second season was confirmed by Netflix, the series' director and lead actor, after Netflix France leaked the news.\n"
