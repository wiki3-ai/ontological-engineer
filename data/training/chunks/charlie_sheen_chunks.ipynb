    "Carlos Irwin Estévez (born September 3, 1965), known professionally as Charlie Sheen, is an American actor. He is known as a leading man in film and television. Sheen has received numerous accolades including a Golden Globe Award as well as nominations for four Primetime Emmy Awards and three Screen Actors Guild Awards. In 1994, he received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.\n",
    "Charlie Sheen followed in the footsteps of his father Martin Sheen in becoming an actor. He starred in many successful films such as Red Dawn (1984), Platoon (1986), Wall Street (1987), Eight Men Out (1988), Young Guns (1988), Major League (1989), Hot Shots! (1991), The Three Musketeers (1993), and The Arrival (1996). In the 2000s, when Sheen replaced Michael J. Fox as the star of ABC's Spin City, his portrayal of Charlie Crawford earned him a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor. He then starred as Charlie Harper on the CBS sitcom Two and a Half Men (2003–11), for which he received many Golden Globe and Primetime Emmy nominations. In 2010, Sheen was the highest-paid actor on television, earning US$1.8 million per episode of Two and a Half Men.\n",
    "In March 2011, Sheen was terminated from his Two and a Half Men contract by CBS and Warner Bros. following public substance-abuse problems, marital difficulties and comments made towards the series' creator, Chuck Lorre\n"

    "Carlos Irwin Estévez was born on September 3, 1965, in New York City, the youngest son of actor Martin Sheen (whose real name is Ramón Estévez) and artist Janet Templeton. His paternal grandparents were emigrants from Galicia (Spain) and Ireland, respectively. Sheen said in 2011 that his father was Catholic and his mother was Southern Baptist. He has two older brothers, Emilio and Ramon, and a younger sister, Renée, all actors. His parents moved to Malibu, California, after Martin's Broadway run in The Subject Was Roses. Sheen's first movie appearance was at age nine in his father's 1974 film The Execution of Private Slovik. Sheen attended Santa Monica High School in Santa Monica, California, along with Robert Downey Jr., where he was a star pitcher and shortstop for the baseball team.\n",
    "At Santa Monica High School, he showed an early interest in acting, making amateur Super 8 films with his brother Emilio and school friends Rob Lowe and Sean Penn under his birth name. A few weeks before his scheduled graduation from Santa Monica High School, Sheen was expelled from school for poor grades and attendance. He then chose to become an actor, and adopted the stage name Charlie Sheen. His father had adopted the surname Sheen in honor of the Catholic archbishop and theologian Fulton J. Sheen, and Charlie was an English form of his given name Carlos.\n"

    "Sheen's film career began in 1983, when he was cast to portray Ron in Grizzly II: The Predator, the sequel to the 1976 low-budget horror movie Grizzly, which remained unreleased until 2020. In 1984, he had a role in the John Milius-directed Cold War teen drama Red Dawn with Patrick Swayze, C. Thomas Howell, Lea Thompson, and Jennifer Grey. His next theatrical release was The Boys Next Door (1985), directed by Penelope Spheeris. While largely ignored by the public, the film was critically acclaimed. The Los Angeles Times review praised Sheen, by saying he is \"marvelous as a kid scared of his own desires--eyes wide open, paralyzed with fear, he looks like a deer caught in the glare of a hunter's headlights\". The New York Times review has also praised Sheen's \"exceptionally well-acted\" performance and compared the film to Badlands (1973), a film starring Charlie's father Martin Sheen for its \"lean and unsentimental\" atmosphere.\n"

    "Sheen had his major breakthrough in the following year, in 1986. He reunited with Jennifer Grey in a small scene in Ferris Bueller's Day Off, where he played a juvenile delinquent Grey meets in a police station. Sheen stayed late up until late hours to have a more authentic look. New York Daily News wrote \"[Sheen] makes a great impact in this one brief scene than anyone else in the movie.\" Film critic Gene Siskel praised the chemistry between him and Grey. Sheen had a supporting role in the coming-of-age drama Lucas, which got a mostly positive reception. Roger Ebert of Chicago Sun-Times said Sheen has the most difficult role to play in Lucas and his performance avoids the clichés usually associated with teen jock characters. Los Angeles Times review has also praised Sheen, writing that he \"exudes naturalness, manages to be handsome without being self-conscious\" and surprisingly \"emerges as the film’s most consistently sympathetic figure.\" He didn't get much attention for the science fiction film The Wraith, despite playing the titular role because critics thought he was underused. In a review for The Washington Post, critic Paul Attanasio mentioned that \"there is all too little of the quietly charismatic Sheen.\" Sheen's big breakthrough role came in the same year in the Vietnam War drama Platoon. The film was a major commercial and critical success and won four Oscars, including the Academy Award for Best Picture\n"

Sheen and the rest of the cast underwent an immersive military‑style boot camp lasting about 30 days, with strict control over food and water, minimal sleep, and blank‑fire exercises to simulate combat stress. Vincent Canby of The New York Times applauded Sheen's performance, saying the character was \"beautifully played.\" The Arizona Republic described the performance as \"terrific\" and Newsday as \"marvellous.\" Variety review noted the similarities he has with his father Martin, making a comparison to his father's Apocalypse Now performance. Both Platoon and Ferris Bueller were among the ten highest-grossing films of the year in the United States.\n",

He got bigger attention in the same year by starring opposite Michael Douglas and his father in Wall Street in which he played the role of Bud Fox, a young and ambitious stockbroker\n"

    "In 1988, Sheen was the part of two ensemble casts, where he played real-life figures. He starred in John Sayles-directed baseball drama film Eight Men Out (1988) as Happy Felsch and opposite his brother Emilio in the western film Young Guns as Richard M. Brewer. In 1989, Sheen, John Fusco, Christopher Cain, Lou Diamond Phillips, Emilio Estévez and Kiefer Sutherland were honored with a Bronze Wrangler for their work on the Young Guns. An avid baseball player since his youth, Sheen has stated that he took the role in the critically acclaimed Eight Men Out not for the money or career but only because of his love for baseball. He passed on Bull Durham to do another baseball comedy film Major League (1989), a critical and commercial success. Sheen's performance as Ricky \"Wild Thing\" Vaughn, which he also reprised in the 1994 sequel, is often considered to be among his most-known characters. Common Sense Media praised his comedic ability in the first film, by writing \"Sheen shines as the rockin' closer with a lot of attitude.\" Empire magazine review also highlighted Sheen for being \"a delightful surprise at light comedy.\"\n",
    "In 1990, he starred alongside his father and brother, in the films directed by them respectively in the drama film Cadence as a rebellious inmate in a military stockade and in the comedy film Men at Work as a garbageman who finds himself in trouble\n"

    ". In the same year, he had a cameo role in Dennis Hopper's thriller film Catchfire and a starring role with Clint Eastwood in the buddy cop film The Rookie, directed by Eastwood himself. The Rookie and Sheen's performance got mostly negative reviews. Roger Ebert has criticized Sheen for his \"low energy and absent-minded performance\". Owen Gleiberman from Entertainment Weekly observed: \"when Sheen slips over the edge and trashes a bar full of hooligan bikers, his performance suddenly comes to life; he should go psycho more often.\" He also took on the lead role in another action film Navy SEALs (1990), which got a mostly negative reception. Los Angeles Times review notes that Sheen's portrayal lacks psychological depth, describing his character as a \"new-style psychopath\" who casually terminates possibly innocent civilians without remorse. Despite this, Sheen's energetic performance adds a layer of gusto to the role. In a retrospective review in 2001, IGN wrote that the role \"is one of many which would forever change his reputation from a dedicated actor (see Platoon or Wall Street) to the fun-loving hell raiser image that first springs into our minds today.\"\n",
    "Sheen starred in the parody film Hot Shots! (1991) and its sequel, Hot Shots! Part Deux (1993), both huge commercial successes. Film critic Janet Maslin praised Sheen, saying \"[he] brings just the right exaggerated seriousness to his ace pilot's role\" and Kenneth Turan also praised his comic timing\n"

Instead, he began taking more action-oriented roles by the mid-90s, to mixed reception. He starred as Aramis in the new Disney version of The Three Musketeers (1993). Entertainment Weekly review described him as \"reliably dry.\" The film was a commercial success but his follow-up action roles in The Chase (1994) and Terminal Velocity (1994) were box office flops.

For Terminal Velocity, Sheen received the highest salary of his movie career, earning $6 million. The film got mostly negative reviews, and Sheen's performance gained him mixed comments. Entertainment Weekly review said, Sheen has some \"fun\" one-liners but generally, he gives \"a boringly flat, square-jawed performance\" whereas Variety review felt \"Sheen's glib, sexy persona suits the befuddled but courageous flyboy\" and Empire review found him \"delightful.\"\n",

    "In the wake of the dismissal, Sheen had a highly publicized meltdown which was broadcast on television and the Internet. He made claims in television interviews suggesting that he was a \"warlock\" with \"tiger blood\" and \"Adonis DNA\", and that he was \"winning\". He also posted videos to YouTube showing himself smoking cigarettes through his nose, and cursing out his former employers. He told one television interviewer, \"I'm tired of pretending I'm not special. I'm tired of pretending I'm not a total bitchin' rock star from Mars.\" After being accused of antisemitism in 2011, Sheen claimed that his mother was Jewish, although Jewish Standard reporter Nate Bloom wrote that he found no evidence to support this and described Sheen's claim as \"exceedingly unlikely\". Sheen said later that year that his father was Catholic and his mother was Southern Baptist.\n",

The video features both rappers as fast-food employees who create havoc while their boss (Sheen) is gone.\n"

    "In 2012, Sheen was cast to star alongside Jason Schwartzman and Bill Murray in Roman Coppola's surreal comedy film A Glimpse Inside the Mind of Charles Swan III. That same year he voiced Dex Dogtective in the Lionsgate animated comedy Foodfight (2012). For the 2013 film Machete Kills, in which Sheen played the President of the United States, he was credited under his birth name Carlos Estévez. It was a one-time move due to the film's Hispanic theme; it was Sheen's idea to use his birth name for the film. The trailer and opening credits for the film used an \"and introducing...\" tag when showing Sheen's birth name. Sheen's next feature film project was the ensemble film 9/11 (2017), an adaptation of the 9/11 stage play Elevator written by Patrick Carson. The film also featured Whoopi Goldberg, Gina Gershon, Luis Guzmán, Wood Harris, Jacqueline Bisset, and Bruce Davison. Sheen's performance gained mixed reviews. Film critic Alonso Duralde of TheWrap wrote Sheen now \"lacks the vitality he once brought to the screen, but neither does he embarrass himself.\"\n",
    "In October 2018, Sheen flew to Australia for his \"An Evening with Charlie Sheen\" tour. During this time, he filmed an advert for car servicing company Ultra Tune, which was the next installment in their controversial \"Unexpected Situations\" series alongside Parnia Porsche, Laura Lydall, Tyana Hansen, and Imogen Lovell.\n",
    "In 2025 a two-part documentary about Sheen titled aka Charlie Sheen was released on Netflix.\n"

Sheen was found in his seaside home by a friend, after which paramedics rushed him to Los Robles Hospital & Medical Center in Thousand Oaks, California, where he was described as being in \"serious condition\" after his stomach was pumped. Days later, Sheen checked into a rehab clinic, then told doctors that he did not intend to stay. Sheen left, but sheriff's deputies forced Sheen back to the clinic. On August 11, 1998, Sheen, already on probation in California for a drug offense, had his probation extended by one year and entered a rehab clinic. In a 2004 interview, Sheen disclosed that his previous overdose was caused by injecting cocaine.\n",
    "On December 25, 2009, Sheen was arrested for assaulting his wife, Brooke Mueller, in Aspen, Colorado. He was released the same day from jail after posting an $8,500 bond. Sheen was charged with felony menacing, as well as third-degree assault and criminal mischief. On August 2, 2010, Sheen, represented by Yale Galanter, pleaded guilty to misdemeanor assault as part of a plea bargain that included dismissal of the other charges against him. Sheen was sentenced to 30 days in a drug rehab center, 30 days of probation, and 36 hours of anger management.\n",

    "Sheen is a lifelong fan of the Cincinnati Reds. In August 2012, he announced that he would donate $50,000 to the team's community fund, which supports various charities. The donation came after the team raised another $50,000 in an attempt to get sportscaster Marty Brennaman to shave his head on the field after a Reds victory. After Brennaman shaved his head, Sheen offered to match the previous donation total.\n"

    "In a 2015 interview, Sheen described himself as a \"constitutional Republican\" and expressed a desire to run for president in 2016. Despite having been an active critic of the Bush administration at the time it was in power, Sheen spoke fondly of George W. Bush in 2014, saying: \"He did the best he could with what he was confronted with, and it is beyond anything I can comprehend\".\n",
    "Sheen has been publicly scathing about President Donald Trump. In 2016, he labeled Trump a \"charlatan\" and wished death upon him. However, in a 2025 appearance on The Megyn Kelly Show during her live tour, Sheen stated that he voted for Kamala Harris in the 2024 United States presidential election, but more recently has \"been listening to both sides\", praised some of Trump's policy, including his negotiated agreements in international conflicts and said he had to \"part ways\" with Democratic Party.\n",
    "Despite being a gun enthusiast in his youth, Sheen has spoken in favor of gun control. In 2013, while discussing Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, he commented, \"If anybody from the NRA wants to look any of those parents in the eyes from that school and tell them that guns are still necessary, then I urge them to, and see how that goes,\" and added that, \"we're not supposed to bury our children.\"\n"
