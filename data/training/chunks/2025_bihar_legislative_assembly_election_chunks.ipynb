    "The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) won a landslide victory securing 202 of the 243 seats in which the election was held, defeating the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD)-led Mahagathbandhan (MGB) which secured just 35 seats. Incumbent chief minister Nitish Kumar took the oath for a record tenth time. Incumbent deputy chief ministers Samrat Chaudhary and Vijay Kumar Sinha took the oath as the deputy chief ministers for the second consecutive time.\n",
    "For the first time, the BJP won the most seats in a Bihar Legislative Assembly election. The RJD, led by Tejashwi Yadav, fell to third for the first time since 2010, while Kumar's Janata Dal (United) recorded its best result since 2010. The Indian National Congress (INC) fared poorly in the election, while the Lok Janshakti Party (Ram Vilas) and Rashtriya Lok Morcha secured seats for the first time.\n"

    "The campaign centered on a mix of local and socio-economic issues. Unemployment and migration were prominent themes: parties noted that many Bihar youth migrate out of state for work, and competing manifestos promised large-scale job creation. Caste politics also remained a key factor. All major parties pledged to support a new caste census and \"social justice\" measures, reflecting widespread calls to address the state's caste-based inequalities. Corruption and governance were attacked by the opposition; for example, RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav accused the Nitish Kumar government of \"institutionalising corruption\" and misusing government schemes (like a women's outreach programme) for electioneering. The ruling alliance countered by criticizing the RJD's past (\"jungle raj\") and highlighting its own welfare record. A major flashpoint was the voter roll revision (Special Intensive Revision, SIR) carried out by the Election Commission. Opposition parties claimed the intensive revision was a partisan tool, alleging mass deletions of voters and promising protests or even an election boycott.\n"

    "On 24 June 2025, the Election Commission (EC) notified that it will conduct a Special Intensive Revision of electoral rolls in Bihar before the elections. The exercise requires all the voters from the state to fill forms to be included in the voter list. People whose names were not in the 2003 voter lists need to provide additional documents. The notification also mentioned that the documents needed to be submitted within a month (with 25 July being the deadline).\n",
    "Further, the voters need to provide one of the eleven documents mandated by the EC, with the common documents such as the Aadhaar card, voter ID card and ration cards, not included as valid documents. A significant number of people in Bihar do not have any of the 11 documents. Furthermore, a significant population of the state migrate in other parts of India for work or study and it is estimated that at least 75 lakh (7.5 million) people from Bihar migrate to other parts of India. Critics have argued it would be difficult for such voters to be a part of this exercise. Such factors have led to fears of mass exclusion of voters. Opposition parties – such as the INDIA alliance – alleged that such an exercise will favor the ruling NDA alliance. The Election Commission denied these allegations and claimed that the exercise is lawful and constitutional.\n",
