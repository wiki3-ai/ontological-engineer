    "In 2002, during the initial outbreak of the Rage virus, a young boy, Jimmy Crystal, flees his house in the Scottish Highlands as his family are attacked by the infected. He takes refuge in the local church with his father, a minister, but finds him praying in ecstasy because he interprets the virus as a harbinger of the end times. Jimmy's father bequeaths him a cross necklace and helps him to safety before submitting to the infected as they break in.\n",
    "Twenty-eight years after its second outbreak, the Rage virus has been eradicated from continental Europe. The British Isles remain under indefinite quarantine with few survivors. A civilised community has subsisted on Lindisfarne, an island defended naturally from Great Britain by a causeway that floods with the tide. Among them are Jamie, a scavenger; his wife, Isla, who has a mentally debilitating illness; and their 12-year-old son, Spike. \n",
    "Jamie and Spike cross to mainland Britain for a coming-of-age hunting ritual. They find an infected tied up and branded with the name \"Jimmy\". They then escape a pack of infected who are led by an \"alpha\", an evolved infected that is stronger and more intelligent than the others. Jamie and Spike shelter overnight in the attic of a run-down cottage, where Spike observes foreign boats on quarantine patrol and a fire further inland\n"

    "The village throws a party for Spike to celebrate his first kill. Spike is upset by Jamie's embellishment of his deeds, and he discovers Jamie's affair with Rosie, the village schoolteacher. He discusses the fire with a family friend, Sam, who suggests that it was made by Dr Ian Kelson, a former GP in exile. The next morning, Spike confronts Jamie over his unwillingness to seek medical care for Isla and his infidelity. Jamie insists that Kelson, whom he once witnessed burning corpses en masse, is too mentally unstable to help. \n",

Spike and Isla are rescued from a pack of infected by Swedish Navy seaman Erik Sundqvist, the sole survivor of a stranded NATO quarantine patrol boat. Isla discovers a pregnant infected and helps it deliver an uninfected baby girl. A paranoid Erik shoots the infected mother and threatens to kill Isla and Spike alongside the newborn if they do not let him kill it, but an alpha appears and decapitates Erik.\n",
    "Spike, Isla, and the newborn flee from the alpha, and Spike shoots him with arrows; despite this, the alpha catches up with Spike. Dr Kelson appears and temporarily subdues the alpha (whom he has named Samson) with a blowgun and a morphine-xylazine dart\n"

Kelson examines Isla and deduces that she has advanced terminal cancer. Kelson consoles Spike with the phrase memento amoris – \"remember you must love\". Isla and Spike share their last moment together as she accepts her mortality and arranges for Kelson to euthanize her, after which he gives her skull to Spike to place at the top of the monument.\n",
    "When Samson infiltrates Kelson's sanctuary, Spike subdues him with a medicated dart and saves Kelson's life. Kelson encourages Spike to go home with the infant. Instead, Spike leaves her at the village gate and returns to the mainland, still disillusioned. Jamie reads a note from Spike that reveals he has named the infant after Isla and promises he will return when he is ready. Jamie tries to follow Spike to the mainland but is blocked by the rising tide. Twenty-eight days later, Spike is rescued from a pack of infected by a group styled after Jimmy Savile. Their leader, the adult Jimmy Crystal, bears an inverted cross.\n"

    "Boyle and Garland have said that 28 Years Later explores themes of British isolationism and cultural decline, with the film’s quarantined Britain reflecting a broader sense of political and cultural detachment following Brexit and the COVID-19 pandemic. This disconnection is mirrored in the film’s depiction of a society absorbed in trivial comforts while catastrophe unfolds elsewhere. \n",
    "The island community in the film represents a post-progressive return to regressivism, where society shifts away from forward-looking ideals and instead toward nostalgic myths rooted in a misremembered past. The society's norms echo those of pre-1960s Britain; authoritarian parenting and 1950s-style conformity illustrate what Garland sees as a collective cultural amnesia where people forget why certain values were previously abandoned. A montage blending authentic British wartime footage with scenes from the film Henry V (1944) reflects the filmmakers’ intention to depict how the isolated community reconstructs a cultural mythology from fragmented and partially remembered aspects of Britain’s past. The sequence illustrates how narratives such as the Battle of Agincourt or the Blitz become distorted through transmission, evolving into instinctive half-truths rather than historically accurate accounts.\n",
    "The characters’ increasing risk-taking over time since the initial rage virus outbreak mirrors society’s gradual relaxation of COVID-19 precautions despite ongoing risks.\n"

In July of the same year, Danny Boyle said that the story for a third instalment had been mapped out. By October 2010, Alex Garland stated that due to differences involving the film rights, the project had been delayed. In January 2011, Boyle stated that he believed the project would be realised, confirming further developments for the story. By April 2013, however, the filmmaker expressed uncertainty as to whether the movie would be made. In January 2015, Garland addressed the project's status, confirming that while it had fallen into development hell there were serious discussions going on behind the scenes to produce the project. Reiterating that development was progressing, he stated that the script he was working on was tentatively titled 28 Months Later. In June 2019, Boyle confirmed that he and Garland had been working on the third instalment. In March 2020, Imogen Poots expressed interest in reprising her role from 28 Weeks Later, followed by Cillian Murphy in May 2021.\n",

In June 2023, Boyle and Garland expressed in collaboration their intentions to \"seriously\" and \"diligently\" see the project enter production; while announcing that the script was now titled 28 Years Later, acknowledging the years it had taken to be developed. Boyle stated that he would like to serve as director, unless Garland chooses to. By July of the same year, Murphy stated that he had recently discussed the possibility of a third film with Boyle; once again expressing interest in reprising his role if Boyle and Garland return to the franchise in their creative roles.\n",
    "In January 2024, it was announced that a third film titled 28 Years Later was officially in development; with plans for the project to be the first of a new trilogy of sequels. Danny Boyle directed the first instalment, with a script written by Alex Garland; while the latter will also write the scripts for each of the planned sequels. Boyle, Garland, Andrew Macdonald, and Peter Rice will serve as producers. In February of the same year, Murphy discussed his potential involvement with the project; that same month, it was reported that the rights to the first film had reverted to Macdonald from Searchlight Pictures. He promptly sold the first film's distribution rights to Sony Pictures, as well as rights to future sequels. In March 2024, Garland confirmed that he is writing a trilogy of sequel films. The following month, Garland said the 1969 film Kes was a major influence\n"

    "Principal photography began on 7 May 2024 in Northumberland, with Anthony Dod Mantle serving as the cinematographer. Filming wrapped on 29 July. The film was primarily shot using an iPhone 15 Pro Max, in addition to action cameras, drones, and other digital and film cameras. The use of small digital cameras harks back to filming the original 28 Days Later using the Canon XL-1 digital camcorder, which was manoeuvrable enough to film the deserted locales within the time limits allowed by officials. The film was shot in a 2.76:1 aspect ratio, reminiscent of productions using Ultra Panavision 70, which was chosen to emphasise the unpredictability of the infected and to heighten tension by compelling viewers to \"keep scanning\" the wide frame.\n",
    "Scenes were shot at 4K resolution at up to 60 frames per-second, and in some scenes the actors performed their own camera work. Some shots employed a bullet time effect, created using a custom-built circular rig equipped with eight to twenty iPhone cameras. This setup also allowed scenes to be filmed from multiple angles simultaneously, giving director Danny Boyle greater flexibility during editing. Boyle explained that using iPhones allowed the crew to film with minimal equipment, providing easier access to the rural landscapes of Northumberland while minimising environmental impact and helping to preserve the area's natural appearance\n"

    ". The iPhone's default camera software posed some challenges for filming because its automatic focus tended to prioritise the brightest or most prominent object in the frame rather than the intended point of dramatic focus, requiring manual overrides to achieve the desired cinematic effect.\n",
    "Filming mainly took place in the north of England, in the North East and Yorkshire and the Humber regions. Locations include Lindisfarne off the Northumberland Coast, Hexham, Bellingham, Kielder Forest, Rothbury (Northumberland), Newcastle upon Tyne (Tyne and Wear), Waskerley (County Durham), Melsonby, Ripon, Fountains Abbey, Aysgarth Falls, Redmire (North Yorkshire) and Bradford (West Yorkshire). Some scenes were filmed at Plankey Mill Farm, near Langley and Bardon Mill (Northumberland). Additional filming took place in Cheddar Gorge in Somerset. Although the Sycamore Gap tree was felled by vandals in 2023, it was digitally reconstructed for the film, as within the film's alternate timeline the vandalism is presumed to never have taken place.\n",
    "The infected characters in the film are depicted in the nude; however, according to Boyle, the actors portraying those characters were required by law to cover their own genitalia with prosthetic genitalia due to the presence of child actor Alfie Williams on the set.\n"

The Independent's Clarisse Loughrey described 28 Years Later as \"a post-Brexit, COVID-19-conscious take on this world\", identifying themes of nationalism and isolationism within the film.
