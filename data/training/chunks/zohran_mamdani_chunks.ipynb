    "Zohran Kwame Mamdani was born on October 18, 1991, in Kampala, Uganda, the only child of postcolonialist academic Mahmood Mamdani and filmmaker Mira Nair. He was given his middle name, Kwame, by his father in honor of Kwame Nkrumah, the first president of Ghana. Both his parents are of Indian descent. His father is a Gujarati Muslim who was born in Mumbai and raised in Uganda. His mother is a Punjabi Hindu who was born in Rourkela and raised in Bhubaneswar. His paternal grandparents were born in present-day Tanzania, and his father's family was part of the Indian diaspora in Southeast Africa. His maternal grandfather, Amrit Lal Nair, was a former Indian Administrative Service (IAS) officer, and his maternal grandmother, Praveen Nair, was a social worker and founder of the Salaam Baalak Trust in India.\n",
    "Mamdani lived in Kampala until he was five, when his family moved to Cape Town, in South Africa's Western Cape province, after his father was appointed head of African studies at the University of Cape Town. He attended St. George's Grammar School in Mowbray from 1996 to 1998, during the early post-apartheid years. He later said that the experience of living in Cape Town \"taught me what inequality looks like up close ... [and] that justice has to be more than an idea; it has to be material\".\n",
    "The family moved to the United States and settled in New York City when Mamdani was seven, and he was raised in Morningside Heights\n"

    "Mamdani attended the Bank Street School for Children on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, where he successfully ran as the independent candidate in a middle school mock election, adopting a platform of \"equal rights, anti-war policies that proposed spending money on education rather than the military\". In 2003, he returned to Kampala for a year and attended school during his father's sabbatical there; his paternal grandparents and aunt still lived there and helped take care of him while his father was working on the book Good Muslim, Bad Muslim.\n",

    "Mamdani is a fan of hip-hop and has composed, performed, and produced rap. Under the moniker Young Cardamom, he collaborated with his best friend, Ugandan rapper HAB (Abdul Bar Hussein), whose origins are in South Sudan, as Young Cardamom & HAB. Their first song, \"Kanda [Chap Chap]\", was about chapati, an Indian flatbread. They performed tracks from their 2016 EP Sidda Mukyaalo (\"No going back to the village\") at the Nyege Nyege festival. The pair rapped in languages including Nubi, Luganda, Swahili, and English, partly to create a unique Ugandan style of rap rather than slavishly imitating American rap, and partly to convey that Ugandan residents with roots in other countries are all Ugandan. The chapati was chosen as a symbol because it originates in South Asia but has become a Ugandan staple. In their music, they addressed social issues in Uganda, such as corruption and \"black and brown relations\", as well as colonialism. Young Cardamom & HAB were nominated for \"Rookie of the Year\" at the inaugural Ugandan (UG) Hip Hop Awards.\n"

    "Mamdani entered New York City politics as a volunteer for Ali Najmi's campaign in the 2015 special election for the 23rd district of the City Council. Mamdani was inspired to join Najmi's campaign after learning that he was supported by Heems, a New York rapper of Indian descent and co-founder of alternative hip-hop group Das Racist. Specifically, Mamdani attributes his involvement in local politics to a 2015 The Village Voice article about Najmi and Heems, whom he described as one of his favorite rappers.\n",
    "In 2017, Mamdani joined the New York City chapter of the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA) and worked for the campaign of New York City Council candidate Khader El-Yateem, a Palestinian Lutheran minister and democratic socialist from Bay Ridge, Brooklyn. Part of Mamdani's motivation for joining the DSA was its pro-Palestine stance, which aligned with his own prior activism. Mamdani served as the campaign manager for Ross Barkan's 2018 unsuccessful bid for the New York State Senate and was also a field organizer for fellow democratic socialist Tiffany Cabán's close-run but also unsuccessful 2019 campaign for Queens County district attorney.\n"

    "In October 2019, Mamdani announced his campaign to represent New York's 36th State Assembly district, which encompasses Astoria and Long Island City in Queens. He was endorsed by the DSA, running on a platform of housing reform, police and prison reform, and public ownership of utilities. Mamdani's June 2020 primary victory over five-term Democratic incumbent Aravella Simotas took almost a month to call, and he won the general election with no Republican opposition in November. Mamdani was reelected without opposition in 2022 and 2024.\n",
    "Mamdani is a member of the DSA's nine-member \"State Socialists in Office\" bloc in New York and a member of the Muslim Democratic Club of New York. He was the keynote speaker at the 2023 DSA convention, saying, \"We are special as DSA electeds not because of ourselves; we are special because of our organization\".\n",
    "As of January 2025, Mamdani was a member of nine Assembly committees: the Committee on Aging; the Committee on Cities; the Committee on Election Law; the Committee on Energy; the Committee on Real Property Taxation; the Black, Puerto Rican, Hispanic & Asian Legislative Caucus; the Puerto Rican/Hispanic Task Force; the Asian Pacific American Task Force; and the Task Force on New Americans.\n",
    "As of May 2025, Mamdani had been the primary sponsor of 20 bills in the Assembly—three of which became law—and the co-sponsor of 238 bills\n"

    "For most of the primary campaign, Mamdani trailed former New York governor Andrew Cuomo in polling. He and Cuomo raised similar amounts of money, but his donor base was considerably larger than Cuomo's. A poll taken shortly before the June 24, 2025, primary election showed that Mamdani had caught up to Cuomo. First-choice results on election night showed Mamdani had a large lead over Cuomo, who conceded the race that evening. His polling margin was increased by ranked choice voting, particularly because he and third-favored candidate Brad Lander cross-endorsed each other by asking their voters to rank the other candidate second. Mamdani and Michael Blake also cross-endorsed each other a few days later. On June 16, The New York Times editorial board advised voters not to rank Mamdani while criticizing Cuomo.\n",
    "On July 1, after the New York City Board of Elections released its ranked-choice ballot tabulation, the Associated Press announced Mamdani had won the primary. It was considered a major upset. A July 2025 poll indicated a shift in Jewish American political attitudes, with 43% of Jewish New Yorkers and 67% of Jewish voters under 44 planning to support Mamdani—levels of support suggesting waning attachment to traditional pro-Israel politics. However, many Jewish leaders and voters remained critical of him\n"

    "During the primary, Mamdani's campaign was supported by the New Yorkers for Lower Costs super PAC, which spent approximately $1.3 million supporting him and opposing Cuomo before the primary and raised an additional $1 million afterward. The super PAC received $100,000 in contributions from the Unity and Justice Fund in May and June 2025. Cuomo accused Mamdani of accepting \"dirty money\", saying the Unity and Justice Fund was tied to the Council on American-Islamic Relations.\n",
    "After Mamdani won the primary, criticisms of and attacks against him used racist, xenophobic, and Islamophobic tropes, particularly references to the 9/11 attacks and terrorism. These criticisms and attacks came from across the political spectrum, and sparked concern and debate over Islamophobia in mainstream American politics. The success of Mamdani's campaign was attributed in part to his use of social media to reach potential voters, especially younger voters.\n",
    "In early November, President Donald Trump threatened to withdraw federal funding for New York City should Mamdani be elected mayor. Mamdani was elected mayor on November 4, 2025. He will be the city's youngest mayor since 1892, as well as the city's first Indian American and Muslim mayor.\n"

In New York City, he advocates raising the local minimum wage to $30 by 2030, implementing higher taxes on corporations and high-income earners to fund free tuition at CUNY and SUNY, universal childcare, city-owned grocery stores, and free public transit, while cutting taxes for outer-borough homeowners and reforming New York's property tax system.\n",

He argues that \"dignified work, economic stability, and well-resourced neighborhoods\" prevent harm better than policing, proposing a civilian Department of Community Safety to handle mental health crises and community outreach. He has voiced support for defunding the NYPD and accused the department of racism, for which he later apologized\n"
