    "Following the conclusion of the previous series, ITV confirmed that the show would return for a twenty-fifth series in November 2025. Prior to the beginning of the series, ITV revealed a new logo for the programme, for the first time since the eighth series. It features a change of design, with the text maintaining the same colours, but with all lettering now in capitals and \"I'm a Celebrity\" written in a thicker font. The lettering is no longer situated amongst the trees in the jungle, but is instead layered on top of the background. Joel Dommett and Kemi Rodgers were announced to be returning to host the spin-off show I'm a Celebrity: Unpacked, whilst Sam Thompson did not return as co-host, however is due to appear as a guest.\n",
    "The first teaser for the series was unveiled in October 2025, and featured a tarantula crawling along a  sideboard in a house that had been decorated for Christmas, with a narrator saying \"'Twas the night in October, and all through the house creatures were stirring, and I don't mean a mouse\" before the words \"'Tis nearly the season\" appeared on screen followed by the jungle drums from the theme tune. Other versions of the trailer began airing one of which featured a girl reaching into a stocking hung from the fireplace and pulling out a star covered in gunge, before shaking it with some of the gunge landing on a family photo\n"
