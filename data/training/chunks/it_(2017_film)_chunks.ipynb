    "It (titled onscreen as It Chapter One) is a 2017 American supernatural horror film directed by Andy Muschietti and written by Chase Palmer, Cary Fukunaga, and Gary Dauberman. It is the first of a two-part adaptation of the 1986 novel of the same name by Stephen King, as well as the second adaptation following Tommy Lee Wallace's 1990 miniseries. Starring Jaeden Lieberher and Bill Skarsgård, the film was produced by New Line Cinema, KatzSmith Productions, Lin Pictures, and Vertigo Entertainment. Set in the fictional town of Derry, Maine, the film tells the story of The Losers' Club, a group of seven outcast children who are terrorized by the eponymous being which emerges from the sewer in the form of Pennywise the Dancing Clown (Skarsgård), and face their own personal demons as the monster torments them.\n",
    "Development began in March 2009 by Warner Bros., with David Kajganich planned to direct, before being replaced by Fukunaga in June 2012. Fukunaga dropped out in May 2015 and was replaced by Muschietti in June. He drew inspiration from 1980s films including The Howling (1981), The Thing (1982), The Goonies (1985), Stand by Me (1986) and Near Dark (1987), and cited the influence of Steven Spielberg. The film was moved to New Line Cinema division in May 2014. Principal photography began in Toronto on June 27, 2016, and ended on September 21, 2016. It was filmed on locations in the Greater Toronto Area, including Port Hope, Oshawa, and Riverdale\n"

Georgie sails the boat along rainy streets, only to have it fall down a storm drain. Attempting to retrieve it, Georgie sees a clown in the drain, who introduces himself as \"Pennywise the Dancing Clown\". Pennywise bites off Georgie's arm and drags him into the sewer.\n",

Bill's classmate Ben Hanscom learns that unexplained tragedies and child disappearances have plagued the town for centuries. Fleeing Bowers' posse, Ben meets Bill's group in the Barrens. They find the sneaker of missing girl Betty Ripsom, and Patrick is killed by drowned children while searching the sewers.\n",

Dubbing themselves \"The Losers Club\", they realize they are all being stalked by the same entity, which they call as \"It\".

On portraying Pennywise, Skarsgård stated, \"It's such an extreme character. Inhumane, It's beyond even a sociopath, because he's not even human. He's not even a clown. I'm playing just one of the beings It creates.\" Skarsgård described the character further, saying, \"It truly enjoys the shape of the clown Pennywise, and enjoys the game and the hunt.\" He also commented, \"What's funny to this evil entity might not be funny to everyone else. But he thinks it's funny.\" On Pennywise's design, Skarsgård stated, \"It's important that we do something fresh and original for this one. It's purposely not going toward that weird, greasy look.\" He also commented on being compared to Tim Curry, stating that, \"Curry's performance was truly great, but it's important for me to do something different because of that\n"

I'll never be able to make a Tim Curry performance as good as Tim Curry.\" Skarsgård also elaborated on his age, stating, \"There's a childishness to the character, because he's so closely linked to the kids. The clown is the manifestation of children's imaginations, so there's something child-like about that.\" Producer Dan Lin spoke of Skarsgård's physical attributes: \"His build is really interesting. He's really tall and lanky, and feels a little clown like in his movement. When he came in — we had a lot of different actors read, and when he came in he had a different spin on the character that got us really excited.\" Lin concluded by comparing the character with that of Heath Ledger's Joker, \"You've had [Ledger] doing almost a clown joker, you've seen obviously Tim Curry as a clown. We wanted someone who created a Pennywise character that would stand on its own and Bill came in and created this character that frankly freaked us out.\" Muschietti spoke of Skarsgård's Pennywise as one not to lurk in the shadows, to which he remarked, \"Pennywise shows up, he's front and center, and he does his show. He has an act. So it's weird all the time, and every little thing implies a further threat.\" Muschietti also spoke of wanting to make the sense of dread that grows in Derry part of the dread of Pennywise, to which he stated, \"He's not just a character that can shape-shift, his influence is all around\n"

Skarsgård has that balance in him. He can be sweet and cute, but he can be pretty disturbing.\" Producer Barbara Muschietti referred to Skarsgård's Pennywise as \"the ancestral clown\", shunning 21st century modern clown characteristics and instead hearkening back to 18th century aesthetics with 'upgrades'.\"\n",

    ". After a while it got a lot easier to say over and over gain  [sic] it was, like, 10 hours filming that scene.\" On the character of Uris, Oleff spoke by stating: \"Stanley, in the group is the last one to believe that It is actually real because he just doesn't want to. It doesn't fit within his reality until something happens. He relates to everyone, but he's the one who tries to organize everything, but he can't. It's falling apart for him and his friends come to support him.\" While Oleff stated Stanley as having OCD remarked: \"He tries to lay everything out in his own mind pattern kinda thing. And Pennywise comes along and just shatters everything. He's definitely the most scared.\" Uris suffers from an injury sustained at the end of Muschietti's It, to which Oleff remarks \"He's been scarred, I guess you can say but Stanley is scarred mentally and physically by these marks. They're permanent, so every time he would look in the mirror he'd see it and be reminded about what happened.\" Oleff spoke of his research into the 1980s in which his parents helped him as \"They told me a lot about the '80s and what music. I've been listening to a lot of '80s music recently. That's helped me get into character. I made a playlist of what I think Stanley would listen to in the '80s.\" Oleff also spoke of the fellowship between his co-stars and himself, where he states \"I think that translates on screen. You could see the friendship we have on and off-screen\n"

With Bowers, he has so many different layers to him, with his father being the way he is and him having to live up to that.\" Hamilton prepared for the role by studying Jarred Blancard's portrayal of the character in It (1990), and in Hamilton's words: \"watched all the bits of my original character\" for research. Blancard spoke to Hamilton, with Blancard giving him advice on how to handle some of the \"psychopathic-ness\" and general meanness of Bowers\n"

Pictures would be bringing Stephen King's novel to the big screen, with David Kajganich to adapt King's novel, while Dan Lin, Roy Lee and Doug Davison would be producing the piece. When Kajganich learned of Warner Bros. plans to adapt King's novel, he went after the job. Knowing that Warner Bros. was committed to adapting It as a single feature film, Kajganich began to attempt to try to find a structure that would accommodate such a large number of characters in two different time periods, around 120 pages, which was one of Warner Bros. stipulations. Kajganich worked with Lin, Lee, and Davison on The Invasion (2007), and he knew they would champion good storytelling, and allow him the time to work out a solid first draft of the screenplay. Kajganich spoke of the remake being set in the, \"mid-1980s and in the present mirroring the twenty-odd-year gap King uses in the book and with a great deal of care and attention paid to the backstories of all the characters.\"\n",
    "Kajganich also mentioned that Warner Bros wished for the adaptation to be rated R which he furthered by saying, \"we can really honor the book and engage with the traumas that these characters endure.\", while Kajganich spoke of Warner Bros. wanting the adaptation as a single film. On June 29, 2010, the screenplay was being re-written by Kajganich\n"

On December 5, 2014, in an interview with Vulture, Dan Lin announced that the first film will be a coming-of-age story about the children tormented by It and the second will skip ahead in time as those same characters band together to continue the fight as adults. Lin also stated that Fukunaga was only committed to directing the first film, though was currently closing a deal to co-write the second. Lin concluded by mentioning King, to which he remarked, \"The most important thing is that [King] gave us his blessing\n"

However, Fukunaga maintained that wasn't the case, with him stating he had bigger disagreements with New Line over the direction of the story: \"I was trying to make an unconventional horror film\n"

Fukunaga concluded by stating, \"We invested years and so much anecdotal storytelling in it. Chase and I both put our childhood in that story. So our biggest fear was they were going to take our script and bastardize it so I'm actually thankful that they are going to rewrite the script. I wouldn't want them stealing our childhood memories and using that. I was honoring King's spirit of it, but I needed to update it.

They do have a scary clown that's taken over the town of Derry, so it's going to be rated R.\" On March 11, 2017, Muschietti, at the SXSW festival, spoke of an element of the pre-production phase in his attempt to keep Skarsgård separated from the film's child actors, wherein the actor wasn't introduced to the young cast until Pennywise's first encounter with the children: \"It was something that we agreed on, and that's how it happened. The day that he showed up on the stage, they fucking freaked out. Bill is like, seven-foot high, and I can't describe how scary he looks in person. He's a wiry man, crouching, making sounds, snotting, drooling, speaking in Swedish sometimes. Terrifying.\" Muschietti stated that the story had been moved forward, with the scenes with the young Losers Club shifting from the 1950s to the 1980s, while also describing their plot as \"getting much wider,\" with new material not in the novel or the 1990 miniseries.

    ". So we were very lucky that the producers didn't try to stop us. In fact it's more our own moral compass that sometimes showed us that some things lead us in places where we didn't want to go.\" In the same interview, on July 12, 2017, producer Barbara Muschietti added that there was only one scene that was deemed to be too horrific to feature in the new adaptation, in which she stated, \"you won't find the scene where a kid has his back broken and is thrown in the toilets. We thought that the visual translation of that scene had something that was really too much.\" Muschietti concluded by emphasizing that nothing was removed from the original vision, nor was the violence of any event watered down.\n",
    "On July 19, 2017, in an interview with Variety's Brent Lang, director Muschietti commented of the monstrous forms that It shall be taking, as well as noting the fact that they'll be very different from the incarnations present in King's story, in which he stated, \"The story is the same, but there are changes in the things the kids are scared of. In the book they're children in the 50s, so the incarnations of the monsters are mainly from movies, so it's Wolf Man, the Mummy, Frankenstein, and Dracula. I had a different approach. I wanted to bring out deeper fears, based not only on movie monsters but on childhood traumas.\" While on the topic of what being the key to a successful horror film, Muschietti concluded by remarking that \"Stay true to what scares you\n"

If you don't respect that, you can't scare anyone.\" Muschietti explained how Skarsgård caught his attention to embody Pennywise, while pointing out that he didn't want the young cast to spend too much time with the actor when not shooting, and encouraged the cast to \"maintain distance\" between them, wherein Muschietti detailed: We wanted to carry the impact of the encounters to when the cameras were rolling. The first scene where Bill interacted with the children, it was fun to see how the plan worked. The kids were really, really creeped out by Bill.

For photographic lens, Chung used Panavision G Series Anamorphic Prime, Angenieux Optimo, and Primo Prime in which Chung stated is used \"when Muschietti wants to use a wider lens or needs more frame space for visual effects. The look of the lenses is nearly the same. I mix them a lot and it works well.\" Cinematographer Chung and director Muschietti's discussions on the lighting of It were of temperature, with Muschietti wanting a hot summer with everyone sweating all the time, while admiring characters with shine on their faces. Both also discussed the balance of making something realistic, but with an element of intrigue that something is not right. Chung mulled over the notion of a period look for It, but ultimately felt the 1980s feel was conveyed through Claude Paré's sets and the work of Janie Bryant, in which Chung stated: \"Trying to make a movie set in the 1980s look like the 1980s can be dangerous.\" Initially he had thought of photographing with 1980s lighting rules and gear, though later feeling it to be superfluous as Muschietti and he were trying to capture a natural look.\n",
    "Muschietti himself found mainstream 1980s lighting too artificial thus preferred to through windows and bounce off the floor, allowing him to convey a feeling of intimacy with the characters, while admiring the approach of unsettling backlights and soft lights\n"

    "Film editor Jason Ballantine spoke of the difference in pacing and rhythm that comes with horror in It, in which a story like this was broken up into individual encounters with Pennywise for each of the characters, thus requiring a particular approach. Each segment had to have the appropriate rhythm and setup for the inevitable jump scare, to which he explained: \"We were definitely conscious of trying to mix the rhythms up. Each encounter became somewhat more elaborate for the jump-scare in terms of what was shot. The first assembly was massively long. So it did mean that screen time had to be dropped, either through the tightening of existing sequences or even scene deletions.\" Ballantine also spoke of the key factors when cutting It, which included King's novel, and Tommy Lee Wallace's 1990 miniseries.\n",
    "In approaching a scene for It, Ballantine mapped out his day-to-day workflow from getting his dailies to sitting down with Muschietti looking through what he's pieced together. Upon receiving the dailies, Ballantine looked through the footage to see if he needs any pickups or reshoots to report back to set, resulting in Pearce Roemer, Elliott Traeger, Ferran Banchs and Daniel Miller to ensure all the footage had been copied over before returning the footage for formatting\n"

    "On August 16, 2016, in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, costume designer Janie Bryant spoke of crafting Pennywise's form-fitting suit and the inspirations to which it drew upon involving a number of bygone times among them the Medieval, Renaissance, Elizabethan, and Victorian eras. Bryant explained that the costume incorporates all these otherworldly past lives, while highlighting the point that Pennywise is a clown from a different time. In designing Pennywise's costume, Bryant included a Fortuny pleating, which gives the costume an almost a crepe-like effect, to which Bryant remarked, \"It's a different technique than what the Elizabethans would do. It's more organic, it's more sheer. It has a whimsical, floppy quality to it. It's not a direct translation of a ruff or a whisk, which were two of the collars popular during the Elizabethan period.\"\n",
    "Bryant played with multiple eras as a way of reflecting Pennywise's immortality and added a \"doll-like quality to the costume.\" She furthered this by stating \"The pants being short, the high waistline of the jacket, and the fit of the costume is a very important element. It gives the character a child-like quality.\" Bryant spoke of the two puffs off the shoulder, sleeves and again on the bloomers, with her desire to create an \"organic, gourd or pumpkin kind of effect\", which includes the peplum at the waist, the flared, skirt-like fabric blossoming from below his doublet\n"

The costume is very nipped in the waist and with the peplum and bloomers it has an expansive silhouette.\" The main color of his costume is a dusky gray, but with a few splashes of color. She concludes the interview by stating, \"The pompoms are orange, and then with the trim around the cuffs and the ankles, it's basically a ball fringe that's a combination of orange, red, and cinnamon. It's almost like Pennywise fades into his environment. But there are accents to pull out the definition of the gray silk.\"\n",
    "Bryant explained that she wished for Pennywise to have an organic element about himself, with herself paying attention to King's description of Pennywise as being in a silvery gray. For Pennywise, Bryant's manufacturer built 17 different clown costumes to accommodate the action in the film. Muschietti spoke of the fact that the entity of Pennywise has been around for thousands of years, thus from an esthetic standpoint wished to depart from the 20th century clown framework, in which he stated \"I think it looks cheap, and it's too related to social events and stuff and circus and stuff. Circus is fine, but I'm more aesthetically attracted to the old time, like the 19th century clown. And given that this guy has been around for centuries, I wondered myself why, why not, having an upgrade that was 1800s?\"\n"

Paré discussed about knowing that Muschietti and himself had to have a culvert entrance in The Barrens, somewhere in or around Toronto.\n",

Paré worked extensively with Muschietti to imagine a haunted house that unleashes a presence that is discovered to be a character in its own right\n"

There was lots of work put into dressing mannequins and putting some heads on them with masks and wigs and so on. Some of them were real people, so they start moving as you see in the movie.\" Conceptually, Muschietti himself spoke of how he wished to keep the cistern more grounded and real, instead of going into a world of fantasy: \"I decided to do a compelling and surrealistic but still grounded physical place.\" Paré originally had wished that the sewers were composed of bricks, due to it being of more period-accuracy, however, the cost was deemed too great thus his team and himself decided to go with formed concrete which was constructed with a mixture of planks and plywood sheets\n"

    "Nicholas Brooks was the overall visual effects supervisor and the visual effects company Rodeo FX worked on most of the visual effects on It, completing 95 shots for the film. Rodeo FX was tasked with creating a number of CG assets to either enhance or even completely replace Bill Skarsgård's Pennywise, amongst others being the giant abandoned cistern within the heart of Pennywise's lair. Both from a technical and creative standpoint, the various shapes created for Pennywise presented a large challenge for Rodeo FX's modeling, rigging and creature FX teams. The visual effects company Atomic Arts were initially brought in to create the paper boat sequence for It, which covers much of the first trailers, to which all of the shots were used in the final film and the company were awarded many more shots in Muschietti's piece.  Atomic Arts highlighted the challenges in creating the paper boat sequence, as Muschietti and Chung shot it in bright sunshine\n"

You're pushing more light through the images overall and the contrast ratio is massive so dark scenes can be even darker but we can hold onto every scary detail. It's a very effective tool to have for this kind of movie.\"\n"

Maybe it is real as long as children believe in it. And in a way, Pennywise's character is motivated by survival. In order to be alive in the imagination of children, he has to keep killing.\" While Muschietti acknowledges it to be a horror film, he, too, felt that it's not simply just that: \"It's a story of love and friendship and a lot of other beautiful emotions.\"\n"

Muschietti spoke of using Fukunaga and Palmer's original screenplay as a basis, however, \"skewed it in a different direction\", to which her brother stated: \"It was a good script, in terms of characters and the depth of characters and such, but it didn't really tap into one of the most attractive traits of the character, which was the shape-shifting qualities.\" Screenwriter Gary Dauberman said influences on It included Stand by Me (1986), while stating: \"that's one of my favorite stories so that's an element I wanted to preserve because it's there in the source material\n"

    "On March 23, 2017, Benjamin Wallfisch was announced as the composer of It's score. Wallfisch stated that Jerry Goldsmith, John Williams, Alan Silvestri, as well as Dave Grusin's composition for The Goonies (1985) were largely influential in the score of It, as he felt so passionate about those \"big thematic style of scoring\", albeit at the same time wishing to go beyond the idea that it would be a purely orchestral and adventurous score. According to Wallfisch, he had to develop a theme for Pennywise which included finding and creating music that could infect all the other melodies as there are several themes in the film but the Pennywise score is a very quiet and whispered childlike tune using very high strings. Wallfisch spoke of Pennywise's second theme, inspired by Skarsgård's portrayal, in which he used the old children's song \"Oranges and Lemons\", which had always disturbed him as a child: \"We knew we wanted some kind of children's song to signify Pennywise's strange and demented inner monologue. I also very subtly use certain melodic fragments from it in other themes, for example the piano music that opens and closes the movie.\"\n"

Damaske also stated, \"One of the chief complaints is that it looked too automatically scary, and that one of the reasons Pennywise chooses his guise is to trick and lure children.\" Dave Trumbore of Collider noted that \"This one's going to divide some folks.

    ". Daniel Kreps of Rolling Stone felt snippet of the film \"was initially similar to Stand By Me (1986), with the Losers' Club playfully bantering about \"gray water\" A series of scary images soon follow before the trailer ends on Pennywise doing unimaginable balloon tricks to lure a victim.\" Matt Goldberg of Collider.com praised the trailer, and stated: \"This new trailer really plays up the kids' role and their fears. It's a smart move, because if a sequel does come along, it's going to be looking at the kids as adults, so that aspect will be lost.\" Digital Spy's Jack Tomlin spoke of the clarity in that director Muschietti's film will carry on down the \"creepy as hell\" vibe he gave the first trailer. On July 13, 2017, Entertainment Weekly released a collection of new images and concept art such as Pennywise's lair to promote It, including commentary from director Andy Muschietti. On July 19, 2017, New Line Cinema showcased its promotion of It, by releasing three reels of footage at San Diego Comic-Con, before an advanced screening of Annabelle: Creation (2017). On July 20, 2017, as part of Warner Bros.'s marketing campaign, an It-inspired virtual reality installation was brought to San Diego Comic-Con entitled FLOAT: A Cinematic VR Experience, which was located at the Interactive Zone across from Petco Park until July 23.\n",

The film continued to hold well in the following weeks, making $10 million and $6.1 million in its fifth and sixth weeks, finishing a respective third and fourth at the box office.\n"

Brandon Katz of The Observer stated that if It lives up to its $60 million prediction, it could be looking at a worldwide total somewhere around $450 million. In August, co-editor-in-chief of Deadline.com Michael Fleming suggested that the film could exceed a $70 million opening weekend, and even hit $80 million at the box office. C.S. Strowbridge of The Numbers estimated that the film would be a box office success, suggesting Muschietti's film to be the biggest hit of the month and dominating the box office in its respective weekend of release. Strowbridge stated that if the buzz of reception increases then a $60 million opening weekend and $160 million total becomes more likely, with Strowbridge remarking that It may even become the all-time highest-grossing film released in September, a record currently held by Crocodile Dundee (1986). Strowbridge remarked that Annabelle: Creation may lose over 1,000 theaters the day It comes out\n"

Sinead Brennan of RTÉ, awarding four out of five stars, described It as a \"film that is just beautiful to look at, while you sit on the edge of your seat waiting for the next scare.\" She praised the performances, cinematography, and production value, whilst speaking of Skarsgård as \"chilling perfection\", whose \"manic energy and presence which brings a level of unease and intensity to proceedings that is just incredible.\", with Brennan feeling Skarsgård's performance was \"career defining\", and deserving to be considered for awards season.\n",
    "Ben Child of The Guardian described Skarsgård as a \"revelation\", while stating: \"There may be something of Heath Ledger's Joker, and a Depression-era New Yoik gangsterism to Skarsgård's vowels, but his ability to go from quiet, leering menace to nightmarish attack mode in a split second is a big part of the appeal.\" Richard Roeper of The Chicago Sun-Times spoke most highly of Skarsgård's performance, with him writing \"Skarsgård's Pennywise shows up only sparingly, and that's a wise choice\n"

Ryan Porter of The Toronto Star felt Wolfhard to be \"charming in what could have been just another nerd role, proving his breakout performance on Stranger Things was more than beginner's luck.\" In his review for The St. Louis Post-Dispatch, Calvin Wilson wrote, \"Muschietti conjures an atmosphere of dread that allows for the occasional burst of humor.\" He continued by praising the performances of Muschietti's young cast, citing Lillis whose \"spunky charisma brings to mind Scarlett Johansson and Emma Stone\".\n",

Christy Lemire of RogerEbert.com wrote that \"Despite the many terrifying moments they endure in their quest scenes that will leave you trembling and giggling at once It is even more powerful in the warm, easy camaraderie between its young stars.\" Lemire praised the \"well-chosen\" cast, saying the \"that combination of tones\" from the performances make the film work. She spoke of Skarsgård as \"working well,\" as he doesn't appear to be laboring so hard to frighten, and that Lillis displays a \"star-making\" performance\".

Katie Rife, writing for The A.V.

    "The film, however, was not without criticism, as some critics were disappointed with the film's implementation of jump scares. \n",
    "Michael Phillips of The Chicago Tribune noted the film's \"diminishing returns of one jump scare after another\", writing that \"nearly every scene begins and ends the same way, with a slow build leading up to a KAAA-WHUMMMMMM!!!! sound effect\". Stephanie Zacharek of Time spoke highly of Muschietti's direction but nonetheless stated: \"Muschietti relies too much on your garden-variety jump scares and now-standard special effects. As always, the horrors you get a close look at are much less terrifying than those that remain unseen.\" Erik Henriksen of The Stranger praised the \"phenomenal\" young cast, but regretted that the film felt disappointingly bloodless\n"

Ideally, we would start prep in March. Part one is only about the kids. Part two is about these characters 30 years later as adults, with flashbacks to 1989 when they were kids.\" On July 21, 2017, Muschietti spoke of looking forward to having a dialogue in the second film that does not exist within the first, stating, it seems like we're going to do it. It's the second half, it's not a sequel. It's the second half and it's very connected to the first one.\" Muschietti confirmed that two cut scenes from the film will hopefully be included in the second, one of which being the fire at the Black Spot from the book.\n",
