    "Madonna Louise Ciccone ( chih-KOH-nee; born August 16, 1958) is an American singer, songwriter, record producer, and actress. Dubbed the \"Queen of Pop\", she has become a cultural icon spanning both the 20th and 21st centuries. Madonna is known for her continual reinvention and versatility in music production, songwriting, and visual presentation, with works that incorporate social, political, sexual, and religious themes and have generated both controversy and critical acclaim. She is often deemed one of the greatest entertainers in the history of popular music.\n",
    "Madonna moved to New York City in 1978 to pursue a career in dance. After performing as a drummer, guitarist, and vocalist in the rock bands Breakfast Club and Emmy, she rose to solo stardom with her debut studio album, Madonna (1983). She has since earned eighteen multi-platinum albums, including Like a Virgin (1984), True Blue (1986), and The Immaculate Collection (1990)—some of the best-selling albums of all time—and Confessions on a Dance Floor (2005), her 21st-century bestseller. Like a Prayer (1989), Ray of Light (1998), and Music (2000) were ranked among Rolling Stone's greatest albums of all time. Madonna's top-charting singles include \"Like a Virgin\", \"Material Girl\", \"La Isla Bonita\", \"Like a Prayer\", \"Vogue\", \"Take a Bow\", \"Frozen\", \"Music\", \"Hung Up\", and \"4 Minutes\"\n"

    "Madonna has starred in films such as Desperately Seeking Susan (1985), Dick Tracy (1990), A League of Their Own (1992), and Evita (1996), with the lattermost winning her a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress. Many of her other films were not well-received. Her business endeavors include the company Maverick (1992–2009), which included Maverick Records—one of the most successful artist-run labels. Madonna's other ventures encompass fashion brands, written works, health clubs, and filmmaking. She contributes to various charities, having founded the Ray of Light Foundation in 1998 and Raising Malawi in 2006, and advocates for gender equality and LGBT rights.\n",
    "Madonna is the best-selling female music artist of all time and the first female performer to accumulate US$1 billion from her concerts. She is the most successful solo artist on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart and has 44 number-one singles across major global music markets. Her accolades include seven Grammy Awards, two Golden Globe Awards, 20 MTV Video Music Awards, and an induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Madonna was the world's highest-paid female musician for a record eleven years across four decades (1980s–2010s). She has become the subject of various scholarly, literary, and artistic works, as well as a mini-academic sub-discipline called Madonna studies.\n"

    "Madonna Louise Ciccone was born in Bay City, Michigan, on August 16, 1958. Her father, Silvio \"Tony\" Ciccone, worked as an optics and military engineer and physicist for Chrysler Defense and later General Dynamics Land Systems; her mother, Madonna Louise (née Fortin), was an X-ray technician. Tony's parents were Italian emigrants from Pacentro, while her mother was of French-Canadian descent. Since Madonna shared her name with her mother, family members referred to her as \"Little Nonnie\". Madonna was raised in the Detroit suburbs of Pontiac and Avon Township (now Rochester Hills), alongside her two older brothers, Anthony and Martin, and her three younger siblings, Paula, Christopher, and Melanie.\n"

    "When Madonna was five years old, her mother died of breast cancer on December 1, 1963. In 1966, she adopted Veronica as a confirmation name upon receiving the sacrament in the Catholic Church. That same year, Tony married the family's housekeeper, Joan Gustafson. They were married for 58 years until Joan's death in 2024, and had three children: Joey (who died shortly after his 1967 birth from a heart defect), Jennifer, and Mario. Madonna attended St. Frederick's and St. Andrew's Catholic elementary schools, as well as West Middle School. She earned high grades—her father gave her a quarter for every A—and was notorious for her unconventional behavior. Madonna performed cartwheels and handstands in the hallways between classes, hung upside down from the monkey bars during recess, and lifted her skirt in class to amuse the boys.\n",
    "In retrospect, Madonna described herself as a \"lonely girl who was searching for something\", explaining: \"I wasn't rebellious in a certain way. I cared about being good at something. I didn't shave under my arms and I didn't wear makeup like normal girls do. But I studied and I got good grades [...] I wanted to be somebody.\" Her father initially enrolled her in classical piano lessons, but she eventually persuaded him to let her study ballet instead. Her ballet teacher, Christopher Flynn, inspired her to pursue a career in dance. While attending Rochester Adams High School, Madonna was a straight-A student and a member of the cheerleading squad\n"

    "In 1978, Madonna left college and moved to New York City. She called the decision \"the bravest thing [she'd] ever done\"; it was the first time she had ever flown on a plane or taken a taxi, and she arrived with \"$35 in [her] pocket\". She settled in the Alphabet City area of the East Village and supported herself with limited means by working various jobs—including as a hatcheck girl at the Russian Tea Room, an elevator operator at Terrace on the Park, and a member of modern dance troupes. She took classes at the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater, performed with the Pearl Lang Dance Theater, and studied under dancer and choreographer Martha Graham. One night, while returning from a rehearsal, two men held her at knifepoint and forced her to perform fellatio. She later found the incident to be \"a taste of my weakness, it showed me that I still could not save myself in spite of all the strong-girl show. I could never forget it.\"\n"

    "In 1979, Madonna entered a romantic relationship with musician Dan Gilroy. During this period, she searched for job opportunities in such publications as Variety, Backstage, and Show Business, leading to a successful audition to perform in Paris as a backup singer and dancer for French disco artist Patrick Hernandez. Madonna told a Playboy writer in 1985 that \"they didn't want me for [...] Hernandez, they wanted to bring me to Paris and make me a disco star\". During her little time with Hernandez's troupe, she also traveled to Tunisia and several disco-oriented European countries before returning to New York that same year. Madonna relocated to an abandoned synagogue in Corona, Queens, where Gilroy and his brother Ed resided and practiced. The group slept in the basement and used its meeting space both to rehearse and record music for their band, Breakfast Club, for which Madonna sang and played drums and guitar.\n",
    "Madonna made her acting debut in the low-budget indie film A Certain Sacrifice, which was shot in two parts in 1979 and 1981. She attempted to block its release through legal action against director Stephen Jon Lewicki but was unsuccessful, and the film was released in 1985. It was primarily criticized for its explicit sexual and violent content. In 1980, after leaving the Breakfast Club and ending her relationship with Gilroy, Madonna reunited with drummer Stephen Bray, whom she had previously dated in Michigan, and together they formed the band Emmy\n"

She enlisted DJ John \"Jellybean\" Benitez to help complete the album, and the two began a brief romantic relationship. Benitez remixed most of the songs and produced \"Holiday\", her breakthrough song. Madonna was released on July 27, 1983, to critical acclaim, and peaked at number eight on the Billboard 200.

In late 1983, Madonna's new manager, Freddy DeMann, arranged a meeting with film producer Jon Peters, who offered her the role of a club singer in the romantic drama Vision Quest (1985).\n"

    "In January 1984, Madonna gained further exposure with performances on American Bandstand and Top of the Pops. Wanting the material on her second studio album, Like a Virgin, to be \"stronger\" than that of her debut, she selected all of the songs herself, five of which she wrote or co-wrote. A dance and synth-pop record, Like a Virgin was released on November 12, 1984, and became her first number-one album in Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Spain, the UK and the US. Within the lattermost nation, the album remained atop the Billboard 200 for three weeks and is the first album by a woman to sell over five million copies. Like a Virgin has sold over 21 million copies worldwide, making it one of the best-selling albums of all time.\n",
    "The album's title track, \"Like a Virgin\", was selected as its lead single. It was her first number-one on the Billboard Hot 100, topping the chart for six consecutive weeks. \"Like a Virgin\" attracted the attention of conservative organizations, who complained that the song and its accompanying video promoted premarital sex and undermined family values; moralists sought to have the song and video banned. Madonna then attracted significant media attention for her performance of the song at the inaugural MTV Video Music Awards in 1984. Dressed in a wedding gown and white gloves, she appeared atop a large wedding cake before moving across the stage in a provocative manner\n"

    "Madonna began a relationship with actor Sean Penn while filming the music video for \"Material Girl\" and the two married on her twenty-seventh birthday in 1985. The soundtrack of Vision Quest (1985) included \"Crazy for You\"—her second Billboard Hot 100 number-one single. That same year, she starred as titlular character in the comedy Desperately Seeking Susan, depicting a free-spirited bohemian drifter whose path intersects with a bored housewife through personal ads. The film introduced \"Into the Groove\", her first number-one single on the UK Singles Chart. Desperately Seeking Susan was named one of the ten best films of 1985 by Vincent Canby, a The New York Times film critic. In April 1985, Madonna began her first North American concert series, the Virgin Tour. The tour coincided with the height of the Madonna wannabe phenomenon, as many of her young female fans adopted her fashion style. Styled by Maripol, her look—which included lace tops, skirts over capri pants, fishnet stockings, crucifix jewelry, stacked bracelets, and bleached hair—became widely associated with 1980s female fashion trends.\n"

In July 1985, Penthouse and Playboy published nude photographs of Madonna taken in 1978, when she worked as an art model. She had posed for the images for modest pay, reportedly $25 per session; the photographs were later sold for up to $100,000. The publication caused significant media attention, though Madonna remained unapologetic. At the 1985 Live Aid concert, she referenced the controversy, remarking that she would not remove her jacket when believing that the media \"might hold it against me ten years from now\".

True Blue made Madonna the second female artist—following Whitney Houston—to score three US Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles from one album: \"Live to Tell\", \"Papa Don't Preach\", and \"Open Your Heart\".

According to the Associated Press, she filed an assault report against Penn following an alleged incident at their Malibu residence over the New Year's weekend. Madonna filed for divorce on January 5, 1989, and reportedly requested the following week that no criminal charges be pursued. That month, Madonna signed an endorsement agreement with soft-drink company Pepsi. In a commercial for the company, she premiered \"Like a Prayer\", whose accompanying music video featured Catholic imagery such as stigmata and cross burning, as well as a dream sequence depicting intimacy with a saint, prompting condemnation from the Vatican. Religious organizations called for a boycott of Pepsi products, leading the company to withdraw the commercial and terminate her sponsorship deal.\n",

Madonna also recorded its theme song, \"This Used to Be My Playground\", which became her tenth Billboard Hot 100 number-one single, the most of any woman at the time. In April 1992, Madonna established the entertainment company Maverick, which included a record label, film production unit, and divisions for music publishing, television, book publishing, and merchandising. The venture was a joint partnership with Time Warner and provided her with a $60 million advance and a 20 percent royalty rate—the highest in the industry at the time.\n"

    "Maverick went on to become one of the most successful artist-run labels in history, signing multi-platinum acts such as Alanis Morissette and Michelle Branch. Later in 1992, Madonna co-sponsored the first museum retrospective of her former partner, artist Jean-Michel Basquiat, at the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York. She released her fifth studio album, Erotica, on October 20, 1992, in the US, and published her coffee table book Sex a day later. Sex featured sexually provocative and explicit images photographed by Steven Meisel and drew strong negative reactions from both the media and the general public; initial interest propelled the book to the top of The New York Times Best Seller list. A Washington Post writer described it as an \"oversized, overpriced, [and boring] coffee table book of hardcore sexual fantasies\".\n",
    "The widespread backlash overshadowed Erotica, which became her lowest-selling album at the time. It debuted and peaked at number two on the US Billboard 200, and received favorable reviews from critics. Two of its singles—\"Erotica\" and \"Deeper and Deeper\"—reached the top ten of the Billboard Hot 100. During this period, Madonna was in a relationship with rapper Vanilla Ice, to whom she proposed. The pair separated following the release of Sex, with Vanilla Ice claiming he had been included in the book without his consent\n"

    "In September 1993, Madonna played an abused wife in a troubled marriage to a filmmaker in Dangerous Game, though her performance in the film was met with negative reception. She launched the Girlie Show that month, during which she appeared as a whip-cracking dominatrix and performed alongside topless dancers. She made a highly publicized appearance on the Late Show with David Letterman in March 1994, using profanity that required broadcast censorship and handing Letterman a pair of her underwear while urging him to smell it. The sexually explicit releases of Sex and Erotica, along with her film roles and controversial Letterman appearance, prompted commentators to question her dependence on provocative imagery. Madonna briefly dated rapper Tupac Shakur and basketball player Dennis Rodman around this time. \n",
    "Biographer J. Randy Taraborrelli viewed Madonna's ballad \"I'll Remember\"—recorded for the film With Honors (1994)—as an effort to soften her provocative image. With her sixth studio album, Bedtime Stories, Madonna embraced a gentler sound and image to regain public favor\n"

During production, Madonna experienced several bouts of illness related to pregnancy and the emotional demands of the film. Upon its release in December 1996, her performance was met with positive reviews from critics. Richard Corliss, writing for Time, described the film as well cast and visually impressive and lauded Madonna's ability to exceed expectations.

    "After the birth of Lourdes, Madonna developed an interest in Eastern mysticism and Kabbalah, introduced to her by actress Sandra Bernhard. Her seventh studio album, Ray of Light, reflected this change in her perception and image. She collaborated with electronic music producer William Orbit to create a fusion of dance, pop, and British rock styles. Music critic Ann Powers said Madonna sought \"a kind of lushness\" for the album rather than the party-oriented sounds of 1990s techno and rave genres, opting instead for a more singer-songwriter approach that Orbit helped her achieve. Ray of Light was released on February 22, 1998, to acclaim from critics. Slant deemed it \"one of the great pop masterpieces of the '90s\", and Los Angeles Times's Robert Hilburn  called it her most satisfying record. Ray of Light debuted at number one in 17 countries. In the US, it opened at number two on the Billboard 200 and yielded the highest first-week sales for an album by a woman at the time. \n",
    "The album's two highest-charting singles, \"Frozen\" and \"Ray of Light\", peaked at numbers two and five on the US Billboard Hot 100, with the former becoming her first song to debut at number one in the UK. At the 41st Annual Grammy Awards, Madonna won four awards, including Best Pop Album for Ray of Light, and Best Dance Recording and Best Short Form Music Video for the title track\n"

    "On September 18, 2000, Madonna released her eighth studio album, Music, to critical acclaim. She collaborated with French producer Mirwais Ahmadzaï, saying that she preferred working with unconventional, lesser-known artists who \"have raw talent and who are making music unlike anyone else out there\", describing Music as \"the future of sound\". The album reached number one in over 20 countries and sold four million copies within its first ten days of release. In the US, Music debuted atop the Billboard 200, becoming her first number-one album in eleven years since Like a Prayer. The record spawned the top-five singles \"Music\" and \"Don't Tell Me\", the first of which became her twelfth number-one on the Billboard Hot 100. The music video for \"What It Feels Like for a Girl\" portrayed Madonna engaging in acts of crime and vandalism, leading to its ban from MTV and VH1.\n",
    "Madonna met director Guy Ritchie in mid-1998 and gave birth to their son, Rocco John Ritchie, in Los Angeles on August 11, 2000. Both experienced complications during the birth due to Madonna's placenta praevia. Rocco was christened at Dornoch Cathedral in Scotland on December 21, 2000, and Madonna married Ritchie the following day at nearby Skibo Castle. After an eight-year hiatus from touring, she launched the Drowned World Tour in June 2001, which visited cities across the US and Europe, becoming the highest-grossing tour of the year by a solo artist with $75 million in revenue\n"

    "In 2002, Madonna starred in Ritchie's Swept Away, a remake of Lina Wertmüller's 1974 film. The film was commercially unsuccessful and universally panned, with A. O. Scott, writing for The New York Times, stating that \"a role like this one requires the surrender of emotional control, something Madonna seems constitutionally unable to achieve\". In May 2002, she appeared in the West End play Up for Grabs at the Wyndhams Theatre, which was poorly received by critics. Later that year, Madonna released \"Die Another Day\", the theme song for the James Bond film of the same name, in which she also had a cameo role that Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian described as \"incredibly wooden\". The song reached number eight on the Billboard Hot 100, and was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song and two Grammy Awards.\n"

    "In 2003, Madonna worked with fashion photographer Steven Klein on an exhibition installation titled X-STaTIC Pro=CeSS. The project was presented from March to May at New York's Deitch Projects gallery and was later shown internationally in a revised version. She reunited with Ahmadzaï to produce her ninth studio album, American Life—a reflection of her views on American society. The record, released on April 21, 2003, was met with mixed reception and debuted atop the US Billboard 200. By 2005, it had become her lowest-selling release, with worldwide sales of four million copies. Its title track was the only song to enter the Billboard Hot 100, where it peaked at number 37. \n",
    "The original music video of \"American Life\" caused controversy due to its violence and anti-war imagery, and was withdrawn after the 2003 invasion of Iraq started. Madonna voluntarily censored herself due to the political climate of the country. At the MTV Video Music Awards that year, she kissed singers Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera while performing \"Hollywood\", which was highly publicized. She then released Remixed & Revisited, an extended play featuring new remixes of songs from American Life and the unreleased \"Your Honesty\". Madonna signed a contract with Callaway Arts & Entertainment to write five children's books. The first, titled The English Roses, was published in September 2003 and tells the story of four English schoolgirls struggling with envy and jealousy\n"

Warner countersued, claiming Maverick had incurred substantial losses independently. The dispute was settled when Warner acquired the Maverick shares held by Madonna and Ronnie Dashev, making the company a wholly owned subsidiary of Warner Music. Madonna remained signed to Warner under a separate recording contract. She launched the Re-Invention World Tour in May, performing across North America and Europe. The tour became 2004's highest-grossing, earning over $120 million, and was later chronicled in her documentary I'm Going to Tell You a Secret (2005).

Malawi's Minister of Women and Child Development, Kate Kainja, had also blocked officials from traveling to meet Madonna and Ritchie as potential adopters. Speaking on The Oprah Winfrey Show, Madonna explained that Malawi had no formal adoption laws for foreigners and described how Banda had been suffering from pneumonia after surviving malaria and tuberculosis.

    "In July 2008, Madonna's brother Christopher published the book Life with My Sister Madonna, which created a rift between the two due to its unauthorized release. In October, Madonna filed for divorce from Ritchie, citing irreconcilable differences. Two months later, her spokesperson confirmed that a settlement had been reached, granting Ritchie between £50–60 million ($68.49–82.19 million), including the couple's London pub, residence, and Wiltshire estate.  The marriage was formally dissolved through a decree nisi at the Principal Registry of the Family Division in High Holborn, London. Custody of their sons, Rocco and David, then aged eight and three, was shared between Ritchie's London home and Madonna's residence in New York, where they lived alongside Lourdes. In May 2009, Madonna applied to adopt Chifundo \"Mercy\" James from Malawi, but the country's High Court denied the request on the grounds that she was not a resident. She appealed the decision, and in June, the Supreme Court overturned the ruling and granted her permission to adopt her.\n"

Produced in collaboration with Cirque du Soleil and choreographer Jamie King, the performance featured guest appearances by LMFAO, Nicki Minaj, M.I.A. and CeeLo Green. The broadcast drew 114 million viewers, making it the most-watched Super Bowl halftime show at the time, surpassing the viewership of the game itself. Madonna primarily produced her twelfth studio album, MDNA, with Orbit and Martin Solveig. It was released on March 26, 2012, to generally favorable critical reception. MDNA was Madonna's first release under a three-album agreement with Interscope Records, signed as part of her 360 deal with Live Nation, which could not distribute recorded music.\n",
    "MDNA became her fifth consecutive studio album to debut at number one on the Billboard 200. \"Give Me All Your Luvin'\" was released as album's lead single, and became her record-extending thirty-eighth top-ten single on the Billboard Hot 100. She promoted the album with the MDNA Tour, which began in May 2012 and addressed themes such as violence, human rights, and politics. Grossing over $305 million from 88 sold-out shows, it was the highest-earning tour of 2012 and ranked among the ten most profitable concert tours of all time. Madonna collaborated with Steven Klein and directed a seventeen-minute film, secretprojectrevolution, which was released on BitTorrent in September 2013\n"

Madonna clarified that her celebrity status \"does not obviate my right to maintain my privacy, including with regard to highly personal items\".

    "While living in Lisbon, Madonna met Dino D'Santiago, who introduced her to many local musicians playing fado, morna and samba music. She was regularly invited to their \"living room sessions\", which inspired her 14th studio album, Madame X. Madonna produced the album with various musicians, primarily her longtime collaborator Mirwais and Mike Dean. The album was critically well received, with NME deeming it \"bold, bizarre, self-referential and unlike anything Madonna has ever done before.\" Released in June 2019, Madame X debuted atop the Billboard 200, becoming her ninth number-one album there. All four of its singles—\"Medellín\", \"Crave\", \"I Rise\" and \"I Don't Search I Find\"—topped the Billboard Dance Club Songs chart, extending her record for most number-one entries on the chart.\n",
    "The previous month, Madonna appeared as the interval act at the Eurovision Song Contest 2019 and performed \"Like a Prayer\", and then \"Future\" with rapper Quavo. Her Madame X Tour, an all-theatre tour in select cities across North America and Europe, began on September 17, 2019. In addition to much smaller venues compared to her previous tours, she implemented a no-phone policy to maximize the intimacy of the concert. According to Pollstar, the tour earned $51.4 million in ticket sales. That December, Madonna started dating Ahlamalik Williams, a dancer who began accompanying her on the Rebel Heart Tour in 2015\n"

However, the Madame X Tour faced several cancellations due to her recurring knee injury, and eventually ended abruptly on March 8, 2020, three days before its planned final date, after the French government banned gatherings of more than 1,000 people due to COVID-19 pandemic. On March 21, she posted a controversial and soon-to-be deleted post to Instagram and Twitter nude from a bathtub, which courted criticism for being out of touch and tone-deaf. In April 2020, Madonna announced her financial support for the COVID-19 Therapeutics Accelerator led by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Wellcome Trust and Mastercard, and she donated an additional $1 million to the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation to help fund research creating a new vaccine. Later that month, she revealed she had tested positive for coronavirus antibodies.\n",
    "Madonna and Missy Elliott provided guest vocals on Dua Lipa's single \"Levitating\", from Lipa's 2020 remix album Club Future Nostalgia. She also started work on a film biopic about her life, which she intended to direct. Erin Cressida Wilson and Diablo Cody worked on the script at various points and Julia Garner was cast as Madonna before the project was postponed. Madonna released Madame X, a documentary film chronicling the tour of the same name, on Paramount+ in October 2021.\n"

Records, in a global partnership which granted the label rights to her entire recorded music catalog, including the last three albums released under Interscope. Under the contract, Madonna launched a series of catalog reissues beginning in 2022, to commemorate the 40th anniversary of her recording career. A remix album titled Finally Enough Love: 50 Number Ones was released on August 19, with a 16-track abridged edition being available for streaming since June 24. Consisting of her 50 number-one songs on Billboard's Dance Club Songs chart, the remix album highlighted \"how meaningful dance music has always been\" to Madonna's career, and became her 23rd top-ten album on the Billboard 200.\n",
    "Throughout 2022 to 2023, Madonna released a number of stand-alone tracks, including \"Hung Up on Tokischa\" (a remix of \"Hung Up\", featuring rapper Tokischa) and a 2015 demo recorded during the Rebel Heart sessions called \"Back That Up to the Beat\" to all digital outlets. She also collaborated on three songs on Christine and the Queens album Paranoïa, Angels, True Love (2023) and with The Weeknd and Playboi Carti on the single \"Popular\", which was taken from the soundtrack to the drama series The Idol.\n"

As part of the announcement, she removed all of her Instagram posts on January 16. However, on June 24, 2023, the singer was hospitalized after being found unresponsive in her New York City apartment. She was admitted for five days and received treatment in the intensive care unit under intubation. Madonna later stated that she had been in a medically induced coma for 48 hours during her hospitalization for a \"serious bacterial infection\" following a low-grade fever. As a result, the initial North American leg of the tour was postponed.\n",
    "The Celebration Tour finally began in October 2023, at the O2 Arena in London and garnered critical acclaim. It ended the following May with a free concert at Copacabana in Rio de Janeiro which was attended by 1.6 million people, setting the record for the biggest standalone concert of all time and the most attended concert by a female artist. The Celebration Tour grossed $225.4 million from 80 shows, making Madonna the first female artist to gross over $100 million with six different concert tours.\n",
    "During these years, Madonna lost multiple family members, starting with her eldest brother Anthony dying in February 2023 at age 66\n"

He died just two weeks after the death of their stepmother Joan. Madonna dedicated a lengthy Instagram post to him saying, \"I admired him [...] We found our way back to each other. I did my best to keep him alive as long as possible. He was in so much pain towards the end [...] There will never be anyone like him\".\n",
    "Following the Celebration Tour, Madonna restarted work on her biographical film and later complained of producers wanting her to \"downsize-down scale-think smaller\" with regard to the project. She considered reworking it into a television series as a result. Madonna shifted her focus towards conceiving new music with Stuart Price, writing in December 2024 that \"these past few months has been medicine for my soul. Songwriting and making music is the one area where I don't need to ask anyone for their permission. I'm so excited to share it with you\". In February 2025, the singer revealed she was working on a \"sequel\" to 2005's Confessions on a Dance Floor, which Price also produced. It is set for release in 2026, via Warner. That May, Deadline Hollywood reported Madonna had partnered with video streaming service Netflix to produce a series about her life with Shawn Levy\n"

    "Madonna has called Nancy Sinatra one of her idols. She said Sinatra's \"These Boots Are Made for Walkin'\" made a major impression on her. As a young woman, she attempted to broaden her taste in literature, art, and music, and during this time became interested in classical music. She noted that her favorite style was baroque, and loved Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and Frédéric Chopin because she liked their \"feminine quality\". Madonna's major influences include Debbie Harry, Chrissie Hynde, Patti Smith, Karen Carpenter, the Supremes, Joni Mitchell, Aretha Franklin and Led Zeppelin, as well as dancers Martha Graham and Rudolf Nureyev. She also grew up listening to David Bowie, whose show was the first rock concert she ever attended. Another inspiration is American writer James Baldwin, whose quote \"artists are here to disturb the peace\" is frequently used by Madonna.\n",
    "During her childhood, Madonna was inspired by actors, later saying, \"I loved Carole Lombard and Judy Holliday and Marilyn Monroe. They were all incredibly funny, and they were silly and sweet and they were girls and they were feminine and sexy. I just saw myself in them, my funniness and my need to boss people around and at the same time be taken care of. My girlishness. My knowingness and my innocence. Both.\" Her \"Material Girl\" music video recreated Monroe's look in the song \"Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend\", from the film Gentlemen Prefer Blondes (1953)\n"

    ". She studied the screwball comedies of the 1930s, particularly those of Lombard, in preparation for the film Who's That Girl. The video for \"Express Yourself\" (1989) was inspired by Fritz Lang's silent film Metropolis (1927). The video for \"Vogue\" recreated the style of Hollywood glamour photographs, in particular those by Horst P. Horst, and imitated the poses of Marlene Dietrich, Carole Lombard, and Rita Hayworth, while the lyrics referred to many of the stars who had inspired her, including Bette Davis, described by Madonna as an idol.\n",
    "Influences also came to her from the art world, such as through the works of Mexican artist Frida Kahlo. The music video of the song \"Bedtime Story\" featured images inspired by the paintings of Kahlo and Remedios Varo. Madonna is also a collector of Tamara de Lempicka's Art Deco paintings and has included them in her music videos and tours. Her video for \"Hollywood\" (2003) was an homage to the work of photographer Guy Bourdin; Bourdin's son subsequently filed a lawsuit for unauthorized use of his father's work. Pop artist Andy Warhol's use of sadomasochistic imagery in his underground films were reflected in the music videos for \"Erotica\" and \"Deeper and Deeper\".\n",
    "Madonna's Catholic background has been reflected throughout her career, from her fashion use of rosary to her musical outputs, including on Like a Prayer (1989)\n"

Her album MDNA (2012) has also drawn many influences from her Catholic upbringing, and since 2011 she has been attending meetings and services at an Opus Dei center, a Catholic institution that encourages spirituality through everyday life. In a 2016 interview, she commented: \"I always feel some kind of inexplicable connection with Catholicism. It kind of shows up in all of my work, as you may have noticed.\"  Her study of the Kabbalah was also observed in Madonna's music, especially albums like Ray of Light and Music. Speaking of religion in a 2019 interview with Harry Smith of Today Madonna stated, \"The God that I believe in, created the world ... He/Her/They [sic] isn't a God to fear, it's a God to give thanks to.\" In an appearance on Andrew Denton's Interview she added, \"The idea that in any church you go, you see a man on a cross and everyone genuflects and prays to him ... in a way it's paganism/idolatry because people are worshipping a thing.\"\n"

    "Madonna's music has been the subject of much analysis and scrutiny. Robert M. Grant, author of Contemporary Strategy Analysis (2005), commented that Madonna's musical career has been a continuous experimentation with new musical ideas and new images and a constant quest for new heights of fame and acclaim. Thomas Harrison in the book Pop Goes the Decade: The Eighties deemed Madonna \"an artist who pushed the boundaries\" of what a female singer could do, both visually and lyrically. Professor Santiago Fouz-Hernández asserted, \"While not gifted with an especially powerful or wide-ranging voice, Madonna has worked to expand her artistic palette to encompass diverse musical, textual and visual styles and various vocal guises, all with the intention of presenting herself as a mature musician.\" In 2004, Rolling Stone ranked her at number 36 on its special issue of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time. \n",
    "Madonna has remained in charge in every aspect of her career, including as a writer and producer in most of her own music. Her desire for control had already been seen during the making of her debut album, where she fought Reggie Lucas over his production output. However, it was not until her third album that Warner allowed Madonna to produce her own album. Stan Hawkins, author of Settling the Pop Score explained, \"it is as musician and producer that Madonna is one of the few female artists to have broken into the male domain of the recording studio\n"

    "Madonna's early songwriting skill was developed during her time with the Breakfast Club in 1979. She subsequently became the sole writer of five songs on her debut album, including \"Lucky Star\" which she composed on synthesizer. As a songwriter, Madonna has registered more than 300 tracks to American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers (ASCAP), including 18 songs written entirely by herself. Rolling Stone has named her \"an exemplary songwriter with a gift for hooks and indelible lyrics.\" Despite having worked with producers across many genres, the magazine noted that Madonna's compositions have been \"consistently stamped with her own sensibility and inflected with autobiographical detail.\" Patrick Leonard, who co-wrote many songs with her, called Madonna \"a helluva songwriter\", explaining: \"Her sensibility about melodic line—from the beginning of the verse to the end of the verse and how the verse and the chorus influence each other—is very deep\n"

Nevertheless, Madonna's first foray into the music industry was dabbling in rock music with Breakfast Club and Emmy. As the frontwoman of Emmy, Madonna recorded about 12–14 songs that resemble the punk rock of that period. Madonna soon abandoned playing rock songs by the time she signed to Gotham Records, which eventually dropped her since they were unhappy with her new funk direction. According to Erlewine, Madonna began her career as a disco diva, in an era that did not have any such divas to speak of. In the beginning of the 1980s, disco was an anathema to the mainstream pop, and Madonna had a huge role in popularizing dance music as mainstream music. Arie Kaplan in the book American Pop: Hit Makers, Superstars, and Dance Revolutionaries referred to Madonna as \"a pioneer\" of dance-pop. According to Fouz-Hernández, \"Madonna's frequent use of dance idioms and subsequent association with gay or sexually liberated audiences, is seen as somehow inferior to 'real' rock and roll. But Madonna's music refuses to be defined by narrow boundaries of gender, sexuality or anything else.\"\n",
    "The \"cold and emotional\" ballad \"Live to Tell\", as well as its parent album True Blue (1986), is noted as Madonna's first musical reinvention\n"

    ". PopMatters writer Peter Piatkowski described it as a \"very deliberate effort to present Madonna as a mature and serious artist.\" She continued producing ballads in between her upbeat material, although albums such as Madonna (1983) and Confessions on a Dance Floor (2005) consist of entirely dance tracks. With Ray of Light (1998), critics acknowledged Madonna for bringing electronica from its underground status into massive popularity in mainstream music scene. Her other sonically drastic ventures include the 1930s big-band jazz on I'm Breathless (1990); lush R&B on Bedtime Stories (1994); operatic show tunes on Evita (1996); guitar-driven folk music on American Life (2003); as well as multilingual world music on Madame X (2019).\n"

    "Possessing a mezzo-soprano vocal range, Madonna has always been self-conscious about her voice. Mark Bego, author of Madonna: Blonde Ambition, called her \"the perfect vocalist for lighter-than-air songs\", despite not being a \"heavyweight talent\". According to Tony Sclafani from MSNBC, \"Madonna's vocals are the key to her rock roots. Pop vocalists usually sing songs 'straight', but Madonna employs subtext, irony, aggression and all sorts of vocal idiosyncrasies in the ways John Lennon and Bob Dylan did.\" Madonna used a bright, girlish vocal timbre in her early albums which became passé in her later works. The change was deliberate since she was constantly reminded of how the critics had once labeled her as \"Minnie Mouse on helium\". During the filming of Evita (1996), Madonna had to take vocal lessons, which increased her range further. Of this experience she commented, \"I studied with a vocal coach for Evita and I realized there was a whole piece of my voice I wasn't using. Before, I just believed I had a really limited range and was going to make the most of it.\"\n",
    "Besides singing, Madonna has the ability to play several musical instruments. Piano was the first instrument taught to her as a child. In the late 1970s, she learned to play drum and guitar from her then-boyfriend Dan Gilroy, before joining the Breakfast Club lineup as the drummer. She later played guitar with the band Emmy as well as on her own demo recordings\n"

    ". After her career breakthrough, Madonna was absent performing with guitar for years, but she is credited for playing cowbell on Madonna (1983) and synthesizer on Like a Prayer (1989). In 1999, Madonna had studied for three months to play the violin for the role as a violin teacher in the film Music of the Heart, but she eventually left the project before filming began. Madonna decided to perform with guitar again during the promotion of Music (2000) and recruited guitarist Monte Pittman to help improve her skill. Since then, Madonna has played guitar on every tour, as well as her studio albums. She received a nomination for Les Paul Horizon Award at the 2002 Orville H. Gibson Guitar Awards.\n"

    "In The Madonna Companion, biographers Allen Metz and Carol Benson noted that Madonna had used MTV and music videos to establish her popularity and enhance her recorded work more than any other recent pop artist. According to them, many of her songs have the imagery of the music video in strong context, while referring to the music. Cultural critic Mark C. Taylor in his book Nots (1993) felt that the postmodern art form par excellence is the video and the reigning \"queen of video\" is Madonna. He further asserted that \"the most remarkable creation of MTV is Madonna. The responses to Madonna's excessively provocative videos have been predictably contradictory.\" The media and public reaction towards her most-discussed songs such as \"Papa Don't Preach\", \"Like a Prayer\", or \"Justify My Love\" had to do with the music videos created to promote the songs and their impact, rather than the songs themselves. Morton felt that \"artistically, Madonna's songwriting is often overshadowed by her striking pop videos.\" In 2003, MTV named her \"The Greatest Music Video Star Ever\" and said that \"Madonna's innovation, creativity, and contribution to the music video art form is what won her the award.\" In 2020, Billboard ranked her atop the 100 Greatest Music Video Artists of All Time.\n"

    "Madonna's initial music videos reflected her American and Hispanic mixed street style combined with a flamboyant glamour. She was able to transmit her avant-garde Downtown Manhattan fashion sense to the American audience. The imagery and incorporation of Hispanic culture and Catholic symbolism continued with the music videos from the True Blue era. Author Douglas Kellner noted, \"such 'multiculturalism' and her culturally transgressive moves turned out to be highly successful moves that endeared her to large and varied youth audiences.\" Madonna's Spanish look in the videos became the fashion trend of that time, in the form of boleros and layered skirts, accessorizing with rosary beads and a crucifix as in the video of \"La Isla Bonita\". Academics noted that with her videos, Madonna was subtly reversing the usual role of male as the dominant sex. This symbolism and imagery was probably the most prevalent in the music video for \"Like a Prayer\". The video included scenes of an African-American church choir, Madonna being attracted to a black saint statue, and singing in front of burning crosses.\n",

    ". Stephanie Zacharek stated in Time that, \"[Madonna] seems wooden and unnatural as an actress, and it's tough to watch because she's clearly trying her damnedest.\" According to biographer Andrew Morton, \"Madonna puts a brave face on the criticism, but privately she is deeply hurt.\" After the critically panned box-office bomb Swept Away (2002), Madonna vowed never to act again in a film. While reviewing her career retrospective titled Body of Work (2016) at New York's Metrograph hall, The Guardian's Nigel M. Smith wrote that Madonna's film career suffered mostly due to lack of proper material supplied to her, and she otherwise \"could steal a scene for all the right reasons\".\n",
    "Metz noted that Madonna represents a paradox as she is often perceived as living her whole life as a performance. While her big-screen performances are panned, her live performances are critical successes. Madonna was the first artist to have her concert tours as reenactments of her music videos. Author Elin Diamond explained that reciprocally, the fact that images from Madonna's videos can be recreated in a live setting enhances the original videos' realism. She believed that \"her live performances have become the means by which mediatized representations are naturalized\"\n"

    "Chris Nelson from The New York Times commented that \"artists like Madonna and Janet Jackson set new standards for showmanship, with concerts that included not only elaborate costumes and precision-timed pyrotechnics but also highly athletic dancing. These effects came at the expense of live singing.\" Thor Christensen of The Dallas Morning News commented that while Madonna earned a reputation for lip-syncing during her 1990 Blond Ambition World Tour, she has subsequently reorganized her performances by \"stay[ing] mostly still during her toughest singing parts and [leaves] the dance routines to her backup troupe ... [r]ather than try to croon and dance up a storm at the same time.\" To allow for greater movement while dancing and singing, Madonna was one of the earliest adopters of hands-free radio-frequency headset microphones, with the headset fastened over the ears or the top of the head, and the microphone capsule on a boom arm that extended to the mouth. Because of her prominent usage, the microphone design came to be known as the \"Madonna mic\".\n"

    "Madonna has built a legacy that transcends music and has been studied by sociologists, historians, and other scholars, contributing to the rise of Madonna studies, a subfield of American cultural studies. According to Rodrigo Fresán, \"saying that Madonna is just a pop star is as inappropriate as saying that Coca-Cola is just a soda. Madonna is one of the classic symbols of Made in USA.\" Rolling Stone Spain wrote, \"She became the first master of viral pop in history, years before the internet was massively used. Madonna was everywhere; in the almighty music television channels, 'radio formulas', magazine covers and even in bookstores. A pop dialectic, never seen since the Beatles's reign, which allowed her to keep on the edge of trend and commerciality.\" William Langley from The Daily Telegraph felt that \"Madonna has changed the world's social history, has done more things as more different people than anyone else is ever likely to.\" Professor Diane Pecknold noted that \"nearly any poll of the biggest, greatest, or best in popular culture includes [Madonna's] name\". In 2012, VH1 ranked Madonna as the greatest woman in music.\n"

    "Spin writer Bianca Gracie stated that \"the 'Queen of Pop' isn't enough to describe Madonna—she is Pop. [She] formulated the blueprint of what a pop star should be.\" Madonna became the first act to be crowned the Greatest Pop Star twice by Billboard (1985 and 1989). According to Sclafani, \"It's worth noting that before Madonna, most music mega-stars were guy rockers; after her, almost all would be female singers ... When the Beatles hit America, they changed the paradigm of performer from solo act to band. Madonna changed it back—with an emphasis on the female.\" Howard Kramer, curatorial director of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, asserted that \"Madonna and the career she carved out for herself made possible virtually every other female pop singer to follow ... She certainly raised the standards of all of them ... She redefined what the parameters were for female performers.\" Andy Bennett and Steve Waksman, authors of The SAGE Handbook of Popular Music (2014), noted that \"almost all female pop stars of recent years—Britney Spears, Beyoncé, Rihanna, Katy Perry, Lady Gaga, and others—acknowledge the important influence of Madonna on their own careers.\" Madonna has also influenced male artists, inspiring rock frontmen Liam Gallagher of Oasis and Chester Bennington of Linkin Park to become musicians.\n",

    ". The Times wrote that she had \"started a revolution amongst women in music ... Her attitudes and opinions on sex, nudity, style, and sexuality forced the public to sit up and take notice.\" Professor John Fiske noted that the sense of empowerment that Madonna offers is inextricably connected with the pleasure of exerting some control over the meanings of self, of sexuality, and of one's social relations. In Doing Gender in Media, Art and Culture (2009), the authors noted that Madonna, as a female celebrity, performer, and pop icon, can unsettle standing feminist reflections and debates. According to lesbian feminist Sheila Jeffreys, Madonna represents woman's occupancy of what Monique Wittig calls the category of sex, as powerful, and appears to gleefully embrace the performance of the sexual corvée allotted to women. Professor Sut Jhally has referred to her as \"an almost sacred feminist icon\".\n",
    "Writing for The Guardian, Matt Cain stated that Madonna has \"broke[n] down social barriers\" and brought marginalized groups to the forefront, by frequently featuring LGBT, Latino, and black culture in her works. An author said that \"by making culture generally available, Madonna becomes the culture of all social classes\"\n"

Canadian professor Karlene Faith gave her point of view saying that Madonna's peculiarity is that \"she has cruised so freely through so many cultural terrains\" and she \"has been a 'cult figure' within self-propelling subcultures just as she became a major.\" GLAAD president Sarah Kate Ellis stated that Madonna \"always has and always will be the LGBTQ community's greatest ally\", while The Advocate dubbed her as \"the greatest gay icon\".

According to Gini Gorlinski in the book The 100 Most Influential Musicians of All Time (2010), Madonna's levels of power and control were \"unprecedented\" for a woman in the entertainment industry. London Business School academics called her a \"dynamic entrepreneur\" worth copying; they identified her vision of success, her understanding of the music industry, her ability to recognize her own performance limits (and thus bring in help), her willingness to work hard and her ability to adapt as the keys to her commercial success\n"
