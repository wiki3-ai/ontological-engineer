    "Born in Seoul, Kim started out as a trainee for SM Entertainment at the age of 11 for almost 10 years beginning in 2003. However, approval for her debut did not happen, either with a group or as a soloist. In 2011, she took a break from training to finish her studies. She moved to the US, and studied at the New York University Tisch School of the Arts, where she received a BFA from Tisch's Clive Davis Institute of Recorded Music in 2014. By 2015, her contract ended and she was dropped from the label, bringing her idol training to an end.\n"

Kim's songwriting \"passion crystallized in 2017 when she attended her first SM Entertainment songwriting camp\". Her first big break came when she co-wrote the topline for \"Psycho\" for Red Velvet, which went on to be certified gold in the US. It led to more opportunities to work with SM Entertainment. In 2019, she was featured on the soundtrack of the K-drama Woman of 9.9 Billion.\n",

    "In April of that year, it was announced that she would be featured on the soundtrack of the Netflix film KPop Demon Hunters. She also wrote several of the songs on the soundtrack. Director Maggie Kang attributed Kim's demos as one of the reasons the film was greenlit; Kim explained she had co-written and recorded \"most of the demos\" for the film when the directors then asked her to be the official singing voice for the character Rumi. The film received positive reviews for its soundtrack. The soundtrack also charted at number two on the Billboard 200. One of the songs she co-wrote and performed, \"Golden\", topped the Billboard Hot 100. On \"Golden\"'s composition, Ars Technica commented that the song \"spans an impressive three-octave range, eventually hitting an A-5 on the chorus–a high note usually reserved for classically trained operatic sopranos\" and Kim's \"performance on this song has impressed a lot of YouTube vocal coaches\". The Korea Herald similarly highlighted Kim's \"Golden\" performance, noting \"the result is both technically impressive and emotionally resonant, a combination that has resonated with audiences far beyond the film\"\n"
