    "Onika Tanya Maraj-Petty (born December 8, 1982), known professionally as Nicki Minaj (  NIK-ee min-AHZH), is a Trinidadian rapper, singer, and songwriter based in the United States. Regarded as the \"Queen of Rap\" and one of the most influential rappers of all time, she is noted for her dynamic rap flow, witty lyrics, musical versatility, and alter egos, and is credited as a driving force in the mainstream resurgence of female rap since the 2010s.\n",
    "Raised in New York City, Minaj began rapping professionally in the early 2000s and gained recognition with her three mixtapes between 2007 and 2009. Her debut studio album, Pink Friday (2010), topped the US Billboard 200 and achieved the largest female rap album sales week of the 21st century, spawning the global hit single \"Super Bass\". Minaj explored dance-pop on her second US number-one album, Pink Friday: Roman Reloaded (2012), which produced the top-five single, \"Starships\". She returned to her hip-hop roots with her third and fourth albums, The Pinkprint (2014) and Queen (2018), which yielded the hit singles \"Anaconda\" and \"Chun-Li\". Minaj achieved her first two Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles in 2020 with the duets \"Say So\" and \"Trollz\"; the former was the first female rap collaboration to top the chart. She had her first solo US number-one song in 2022 with \"Super Freaky Girl\", the lead single from her fifth studio album, Pink Friday 2 (2023)\n"

    "Onika Tanya Maraj was born on December 8, 1982, in the Saint James district of Port of Spain, Trinidad and Tobago. Her father was Robert Maraj (1956–2021), a financial executive and part-time gospel singer of Dougla (Afro-Trinidadian mother and Indo-Trinidadian father) descent. Her mother, Carol, is also a gospel singer with Afro-Trinidadian ancestry. Carol worked in payroll and accounting departments during Minaj's youth. Minaj's father was an alcoholic and crack cocaine addict whom Minaj described to be \"violent\" and abusive to her mother. He committed arson on their house in December 1987. She has an older brother named Jelani, a younger brother named Micaiah, and a younger half-sister named Ming.\n",
    "As a child, Minaj and Jelani grew up with their grandmother in Saint James in a household with 11 cousins. Carol was working numerous jobs in Saint James before getting her green card at the age of 24. She then moved to the Bronx in New York to attend Monroe College, leaving both Minaj and Jelani in Trinidad with their grandmother. When Minaj was five, Carol brought Minaj and Jelani to live with her and their father in South Jamaica, Queens. Minaj said she arrived in the United States as an illegal immigrant, and by the time she moved to the country, her mother and father had lawful permanent residency. She stated in 2024 that she is not a US citizen. Minaj recalled, \"I don't think I had a lot of discipline in my household. My mom motivated me, but it wasn't a strict household\n"

    "From 2002 to 2004, Minaj rapped in a New York hip hop group called Hoodstars, which included rappers Lou$tar and 7even Up and hype man Safaree Samuels. The son of Bowlegged Lou from Full Force, Lou$tar recruited Minaj when he and his father heard her work. Bowlegged Lou liked Minaj's rapping, and said that back then she was already doing \"the crazy voices\" in her vocal performances. In 2004, the group recorded the entrance song for WWE Diva Victoria, \"Don't Mess With\", which was featured on the compilation album ThemeAddict: WWE The Music, Vol.6. Full Force tried to get Hoodstars a record deal but were unsuccessful. They then worked with Minaj as a solo artist, meeting with some record companies, including Warner Brothers, who expressed interest in signing Minaj out of the group but required a ghostwriter for a deal. Minaj refused, adamant that she will always write her songs. Brian George from Full Force said that Minaj was impressive in her ambition, describing her as \"broke and hungry\" while determined to be in control of her craft.\n",
    "Minaj continued to work independently and uploaded her songs on her Myspace profile, sending several of them to people in the music industry. In 2006, Fendi, who owned the Brooklyn production company Dirty Money Entertainment, reached out to Minaj on Myspace, and signed her to Dirty Money under a 180-day contract\n"

She filmed a music video for the track \"Click Clack\", which was featured on the underground rap DVD The Come Up Vol. 11. Her rap on the DVD caught the attention of rapper Lil Wayne, who got in contact with Fendi to set up a call with Minaj and asked her to join his crew he was assembling for his new imprint called Young Money. Minaj collaborated with Wayne, who featured on her next mixtapes, but she did not sign a contract with Young Money then. She continued working on her songs, communicating with fans on social media, and booking shows.\n",

In the summer of 2009, Minaj performed on a tour headlined by Wayne featuring artists from Young Money, among others. At the time she was managed by Debra Antney.

    ". Records and she countered with an offer for him to manage her, which he declined. Minaj's mixtapes, freestyles, and features on other artists' songs garnered significant industry and public interest. While she continued playing shows, working on music, and collaborating with other artists, there was a bidding war among record labels to sign her. In late August, Minaj signed a recording contract with Young Money, with her deal entailing her owning her 360 rights, including her merchandising, sponsorships, endorsements, touring and publishing. In a 2011 interview, Minaj said that before she met Lil Wayne, \"the person that was spearheading my career was the one person who always told me, 'Don't be too playful, don't be too kooky and weird... no one's gonna feel that, nobody wants to hear that.' So I stifled a lot of that early on, and then once that we parted ways, I was like, 'Guess what, I'm gonna just be me.'\" In October 2009, she performed a freestyle at the 2009 BET Hip Hop Awards cypher. The following month, she appeared with Gucci Mane and Trina on the remix of \"5 Star Bitch\" by Yo Gotti.\n",
    "In early February 2010, Minaj made her first two appearances on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 chart with her features on \"Knockout\" and \"Up Out My Face\" by Lil Wayne and Mariah Carey respectively. Minaj also appeared on \"BedRock\" and \"Roger That\" on the compilation album, We Are Young Money (2009). The singles peaked at numbers two and 56, respectively, in the U.S\n"

Intended as the lead single from her forthcoming debut album, Pink Friday, the song was dropped from the album due to poor commercial performance. The next single, \"Your Love\", later became the album's lead single. Released in June, it peaked at number 14 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 and number one on the Rap Songs chart. The rapper was then featured on Christina Aguilera's song \"Woohoo\", which reached number 46 on the Canadian Hot 100 and number 79 on Billboard Hot 100. In September, Minaj released \"Check It Out\" with will.i.am and \"Right Thru Me\" as follow-up singles.\n",
    "In October, Minaj was featured on Kanye West's \"Monster\", a posse cut with Jay-Z and Rick Ross featuring vocals from Justin Vernon of Bon Iver. Her verse received widespread acclaim with many critics regarding it as the best verse on that song. Complex rated Minaj's \"Monster\" verse as the number-one best rap verse in the past five years, while Sean Fennessey of The Village Voice stated that \"Monster\" was \"the track that announced Minaj's \"brilliance\" to most people.\" Shortly after, she performed \"Monster\" with West and Jay-Z at Yankee Stadium, becoming the first ever female rapper to perform there\n"

    "Pink Friday was released on November 19, 2010, debuting at number two and later reaching number one on the Billboard 200, with first-week sales of 375,000 copies. It had the largest sales week for a female rap album in the 21st century and second-highest sales week overall after Lauryn Hill's The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill (1998). The album also became the female rap album with the most weeks in the top ten on the Billboard 200 chart at the time, with fourteen consecutive weeks in the region. Upon release, the album received generally positive reviews from critics. The song \"Roman's Revenge\", featuring Eminem, was interpreted as a response to rapper Lil' Kim's comments against Minaj, including her accusing Minaj of copying her image and that she had recorded a song called \"Everywhere We Go\" with Minaj but it was pulled from iTunes by Cash Money because it did not perform well. At the time, Minaj said that \"Roman's Revenge\" was not about a specific person, but about \"everyone who has been in interviews talking\", adding, \"I've been quiet for such a long time and I've been the nice guy. I've been the person that gave everyone their props ... you can't be a rapper and not speak on things being said about you\"\n"

The song reached number five on the US Billboard Hot 100, was the fifth best-selling single of 2012, and was certified diamond by the RIAA in November 2024, for moving over ten million units in the US. Her crossover into pop music was criticized by some, despite her commercial success. Follow-up singles \"Beez in the Trap\" featuring 2 Chainz and \"Right by My Side\" featuring Chris Brown were released shortly after.\n",
    "Pink Friday: Roman Reloaded was eventually released on April 2, 2012, two months later than initially planned. It was preceded by the promotional singles \"Roman in Moscow\" and \"Stupid Hoe\". The latter song was viewed by critics as a diss aimed at Lil' Kim, following her previous attacks on Minaj. The album debuted at number one on the Billboard 200, with first-week sales of 253,000 copies, and was certified four-times platinum by the RIAA in November 2024, becoming Minaj's highest-certified album yet. However, the mix of hip-hop songs and mainstream pop material received mixed reviews. \"Pound the Alarm\" and \"Va Va Voom\" were later released as the final singles from the album. Minaj along with fellow rapper M.I.A. joined Madonna to perform the single, \"Give Me All Your Luvin\" during the Super Bowl XLVI halftime show on February 6, 2012\n"

Although she was scheduled to headline the June 3 Hot 97 Summer Jam at MetLife Stadium in New Jersey, at the request of Lil Wayne she canceled her appearance the day of the show after Peter Rosenberg of the station dismissed her single \"Starships\" as \"not real hip-hop\". The following month, she voiced Steffie in the animated film Ice Age: Continental Drift (2012). Minaj won awards for Best Female Video (for \"Starships\") at the 2012 MTV Video Music Awards and Best Hip-Hop at the 2012 MTV Europe Music Awards.\n",

That month, she was the subject of a three-part E! documentary titled Nicki Minaj: My Truth. In September, Minaj joined the judges' panel for the twelfth season of American Idol with Mariah Carey, Keith Urban, and Randy Jackson. Throughout the show there were disagreements between Carey and Minaj, with both of them leaving the series at the end of the season\n"

It debuted at number two on the U.S. Billboard 200 with 185,000 album-equivalent units, of which 78,000 came from pure album sales. It also debuted at number five in the UK and at number four in Australia, marking Minaj's highest debut in the latter country. Minaj later expressed frustration and criticized several people including Travis Scott, whose album Astroworld claimed the top spot for a second week in a row, blocking Queen from the top spot. Minaj alleged that Travis Scott sold shirts, merchandise, and ticket passes for an unnannounced tour to boost his album sales. This controversy and Queen's roll-out was documented by several news outlets and commentators. Queen received generally positive reviews, with some critics deriding the album's length and direction. The album was certified Platinum by the RIAA in January 2019, for moving over 1 million equivalent units.\n",

Naming other examples of category mismatches, she said that if the song was not considered fitting for the rap category, Latto's \"Big Energy\", which has the same producer, would also not be suitable for the category. Minaj argued that her song was moved to pop to have less competition in the rap categories, alleging that it is part of a general corporate agenda to prop up newer artists over veterans.

    "Minaj is known for her animated rap flow, witty lyrics, and musical versatility. Her rapping is distinctive for its varying cadence and speed, and use of alter egos and accents, including British cockney. In 2010, Minaj said that she aimed to be \"a balanced artist ... this is all years of me learning me and my style, and deciding to do something different that would get everyone's attention.\" She stated that animation and performance was always a part of her and came naturally in her artistry, and her performing arts background also contributed to it. She regards rapping as both an art and a sport, enjoys changing up her rap flow, and sometimes spends hours revising her work. \"I love that people never know what Nicki they are going to get on a particular song. I like bringing out a different side.\"\n",
    "Minaj has made use of metaphors, punch lines, and word play. She often incorporates personas, using different accents or cadences. Marc Hogan of Spin said that through her character Roman, Minaj \"tap[ped] into the fire-breathing, giddily nihilistic spirit that drew so many rap heads to her mixtapes ... as well as her guest appearances on others' tracks. Jon Caramanica of The New York Times called Minaj a \"nimble, evocative rapper\" and \"intricate lyricist\" with a \"gift for comic accents and unexpected turns of phrase. She's a walking exaggeration, outsize in sound, personality and look\n"

Writing for Paper magazine, Liza Dye said that Minaj's first mixtape \"established her lyrical talent and knack for creating a colorful world filled with witty rap references, vocal impressions and memorable characters.\" The New York Times' Roxane Gay characterized Minaj's work by \"urgent lyrics, spitting in a range of voices and accents\", containing \"wit and sly humor\", and her raps ranging \"from bold and aggressive, to coquettish, to wanton and sultry, with a soupçon of women's empowerment\", while her pace \"is often breathless but her diction is impeccable.\"\n",
    "AllMusic described her artistry as a \"unique combination of ferocity and humor, and a rap style built on razor-sharp wordplay, mercilessly blunt lyricism, and delivery that turns on a dime from sugary to snarling\". Evening Standard's Jochan Embley wrote that her lyrics \"stare gender and race in the eye\", and are \"fierce, hilarious, bombastic and deadly serious, often all bundled together in one.

Writing for Esquire, Terron Moore said that one of Minaj's traits as an artist is her \"fearlessness\", a staple of \"Nicki the Lyricist, the venomous, schizophrenic man eater who out-pens her male competitors, and her trail of guest verses\". Robby Seabrook III of XXL included Minaj in a list of \"most unique flows from rappers over the last five years\", writing that she \"has solidified her spot as a leader of the pack for her animated flows, inspiring many other women in hip-hop to play with their vocals. She goes from campy to bellicose, excited to eccentric, oftentimes all on one song.\"\n",

She recalled that \"fantasy was my reality\" and her first identity was Cookie. She then moved on to Harajuku Barbie and, later, Nicki Minaj. In November 2010, Minaj assumed the alter ego Nicki Teresa, wearing a colorful headdress and calling herself \"healer to her fans\" during a visit to the Garden of Dreams Foundation at Fuse Studios in New York. She introduced another alter ego, Rosa (pronounced with an exaggerated R), to commemorate her December 2010 appearance on Lopez Tonight.\n",
    "One of Minaj's most well-known alter-egos is Roman Zolanski, who Minaj described as a \"demon\", a \"lunatic\", and a gay boy that lives inside of her. On \"Roman's Revenge\", Minaj and Eminem collaborated as their respective alter egos Roman and Slim Shady. Minaj also introduced the character of Roman's proper British mother, Martha, in \"Roman's Revenge\". In December 2023, in response to a fan inquiry on Martha ever returning, Minaj confirmed that Martha had died of old age. Minaj's other personas in her music include Chun-Li and Queen Sleeze.\n"

Complex stated that \"from her bold outfits to her multi-colored wigs, Minaj oozed confidence that inspired others who were watching closely\". Glamour included Minaj in its list of 104 women who defined 2010s pop culture. XXL's Zoe Johnson called her \"one of the most versatile MCs to bless a mic\", adding that she \"helped birth a new generation of rappers that mimic her style and revamp her legendary bars\n"

Kanye West considered Minaj \"the scariest artist in the game right now\". \"She has the most potential out of everyone to be the number-two rapper of all time, cause nobody's gonna be bigger than Eminem\". 50 Cent called Minaj an \"alpha female\", adding that \"[she] happens to be a girl, but that n***a is tough\".

The Huffington Post described her style as \"risk-taking\" and \"far-out\", with \"bold sartorial choices\"; In 2014, Minaj reinvented her image, sporting a \"natural\" and \"softer\" look, wearing fewer wigs and less colourful costumes. She stated that she \"went so far to the other side that there's only one place to go from there. You can either continue doing costumes or you can just say, \"Hey guess what?

I feel like women can do anything that they put their minds to.\" In a 2018 interview, she discussed sex workers, her own sex appeal, and sexuality in music and on social media, which attracted criticism. In The New York Times Magazine, music critic Vanessa Grigoriadis said that Minaj \"has become expert at modelling the ways that women can wield power in the industry. But she has also drawn attention to the ways in which power can be embodied by a woman standing up for herself and speaking her own mind.\" The cover art and music video for her 2014 single, \"Anaconda\", attracted significant media attention upon release\n"

Another writer for The Guardian said, of the \"Anaconda\" video, Minaj turns \"the classic song into a conversation, and [refuses] to let the camera objectify her lap dance by keeping it zoomed out, at a distance.\"\n",
    "Minaj's outspoken views, feuds with several rappers, personal life, and fanbase have received significant media attention.

It was auctioned on the Charitybuzz website; proceeds benefited nonprofit Project Angel Food. A spokesperson for Mattel stated that, \"Barbie is obviously a pop culture icon [...] and Nicki is a big part of pop culture and also huge within the fashion industry, as well as a big Barbie fan.\" Matthew Perpetua of Rolling Stone stated that the \"Minaj Barbie doll is notable in that the rapper has made Barbie dolls a crucial part of her aesthetic.\" Minaj helped introduce the Casio TRYX in Times Square, and created a six-piece nail polish collection for OPI Products with colors named after her songs.\n",
    "In February 2012, Minaj launched her own range of lip products for MAC Cosmetics' Viva Glam. In April 2012, Minaj helped launch the Nokia Lumia 900 in Times Square.

    "In an interview with Rolling Stone, Minaj revealed that she had an abortion as a teenager, which she had referenced in her songs \"Autobiography\" and \"All Things Go\". She said that it was the hardest thing she had gone through, and although it \"haunted\" her she stands by her decision as she \"didn't have anything to offer a child\" and she is pro-choice. In July 2011, her cousin Nicholas Telemaque was murdered near his home in Brooklyn, an incident she referenced in \"All Things Go\" and \"Champion\". Minaj's father, Robert Maraj, died in February 2021 in a hit-and-run accident in Long Island. Charles Polevich, a 70-year-old man, was charged with leaving the scene of incident involving death of a person and tampering with or suppressing physical evidence.\n",
    "Minaj has been involved in a widely publicized feud with fellow rapper Cardi B since around 2017. At a New York Fashion Week after-party in 2018, Cardi B threw one of her high heel shoes in Minaj's direction and attempted to physically attack her; bodyguards intervened, leaving Cardi B with a bump on her forehead. She then alleged on Instagram that Minaj had \"liked\" negative social media comments about her ability to take care of her newborn daughter. Minaj denied the allegations on her Queen Radio show, stating that she \"would never...speak ill of anyone's child\", and expressed embarrassment at the incident\n"

    "In September 2021, Minaj responded to a fan's question about her lack of appearances at public events, stating that she did not want to put her infant at risk due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and that she had tested positive for the virus and had to quarantine from her son. She said she was getting the COVID-19 vaccine after she felt she had done enough research, and she would be vaccinated before she went on tour. She had also tweeted that her cousin in Trinidad told her that his friend suffered swollen testicles and became impotent after taking the vaccine, a claim that received backlash and was denied by Trinidad and Tobago health minister Terrence Deyalsingh, who stated that there was no evidence of that. In May 2022, Olivia Truffaut-Wong of The Cut stated that Minaj had likely gotten vaccinated as the 2022 Met Gala (which Minaj attended) required proof of vaccination and a negative COVID-19 PCR test to attend.\n",

    "Minaj's husband Kenneth Petty was convicted of attempted rape at age 16 in 1995, serving four years in prison and registering as a sex offender upon release. When Minaj and her husband moved to California, he failed to update his residence on the sex offender registration and was indicted in February 2020; he registered in the state's database by the following month. In August 2021, Jennifer Hough, the woman who accused Petty when they were both 16, filed a lawsuit against the couple alleging harassment, intimidation and infliction of emotional distress, and requested a $20 million default judgement when Minaj did not respond to the lawsuit in time; the court declined it, declaring that Minaj was not in default. Minaj filed a response, calling the allegations \"blatant falsehoods\" and including evidence of discrepancies in Hough's story. Minaj stated that she \"never asked [Hough] to change her story\", \"never offered her any money in return for a statement\", and \"did not threaten her with any type of harm\". She stated that, after her husband's indictment, Hough contacted her via a mutual acquaintance, and in their phone call, indirectly asked Minaj for a payoff, \"mistakenly believ[ing] that I would pay her money to take back her accusation against my husband\"\n"
