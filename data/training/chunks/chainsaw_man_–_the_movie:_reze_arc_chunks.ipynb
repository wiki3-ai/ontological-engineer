    "Following Katana Man's defeat, Public Safety division leader Makima assigns the fanatical shark devil Beam as temporary partner to the devil hunter Denji (Chainsaw Man) while his regular partner Power has her excess blood drained. Makima takes Denji on a movie marathon date; both dislike all but the final film in the program, which moves them to tears. During the date, Makima reassures Denji that he has a heart capable of feeling.\n",
    "Denji is caught in a storm while patrolling and takes shelter in a phone booth, where he meets a girl named Reze and later visits her at the café where she works. Her behavior leads Denji to believe she has feelings for him, though he is conflicted over his simultaneous attraction to Makima. Meanwhile, devil hunter Aki Hayakawa is assigned the Angel Devil as his new partner, whose touch shortens the lifespan of mortals. Angel's laziness and apathy towards humans become sources of mutual tension.\n",
    "Denji and Reze sneak into her school at night, where they skinny dip in the outdoor pool and she teaches him to swim. While separated from Denji, Reze is suddenly ambushed by an assassin who aims to torture her to control Denji; she feigns weakness before quickly killing the man and allying with his partnered devil, the Typhoon Devil. The day after, while watching fireworks at a festival, Reze asks Denji to run away with her. He hesitates, leading to her realization that there's another woman in Denji's life\n"

    "Beam retreats with the injured Denji to a Public Safety office, where they find Aki and Angel; the four escape by car as Reze slaughters the other hunters. As she chases them through the streets, a revived Denji retaliates but is easily defeated. Aki and the Violence Fiend fend off Reze, but the Typhoon Devil arrives to assist her. Denji is revived by Angel using the blood of a nearby casualty and suggests using his chainsaw abilities tactically in the fight, giving him the idea to ride Beam's shark form in the battle. Amidst the fight, the Typhoon Devil's winds pull in Angel before Aki catches his shirt. Intent on dying, Angel begs him to let go but Aki secures him by grabbing his bare hand, taking months off his lifespan.\n",
    "Denji and Beam kill the Typhoon Devil, though Reze severely injures Beam. The confrontation leads them to the coastline, where Denji uses his chains to bind Reze to him and jumps into the water, preventing her from using her abilities as they sink to the seabed. All three wash ashore the following morning, where Reze concedes that her mission has failed and she never had feelings for Denji. He replies that if that were truly the case, she wouldn't have taught him to swim\n"

Reze prepares to board a train before having a change of heart and deciding to meet with Denji. However, she is intercepted by Makima and attacked by Angel in the alley leading to the café. As she bleeds out, Reze wonders why she did not try to kill Denji when they first met and admits never having gone to school either. In a post-credits scene, Denji holds a flower bouquet and appears depressed as Reze never showed up. Power arrives instead and asks if the flowers are a gift for her. He considers giving her the bouquet before eating it instead, causing them to squabble.\n"

    "It was announced that the cast from the anime series would return to their respective roles for the film, but there were some staff changes. Tatsuya Yoshihara was confirmed to direct the film, replacing Ryu Nakayama, who directed the first season of the anime. Sota Shigetsugu joined the production as Action Director, the role Yoshihara served in for the first season of the anime. \n",
    "The majority of the core staff, however, remained unchanged, with Kazutaka Sugiyama returning as character designer. Sugiyama stated on X, formerly known as Twitter, that he, Yoshihara, and other core staff members collaborated to modify the character designs for the film to better reflect the style of Tatsuki Fujimoto's manga series Chainsaw Man. In turn, the film’s visual approach differed from the anime’s first season, with the majority of the audience responding positively to the film’s new style.\n"

    "On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 96% of 46 critics' reviews are positive. The website's consensus reads: \"Revving up the carnage while maintaining a perversely sweet emotional core, Chainsaw Man's big screen debut is a bloody feast rendered in eye-popping animation.\" Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 71 out of 100, based on 13 critics, indicating \"generally favorable\" reviews. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A\" on an A+ to F scale.\n",
    "Richard Eisenbeis of Anime News Network graded the film an A, praising its animation, visuals, action sequences, music, and story, while noting about Denji and Reze's deep bittersweet love story which makes the film \"worth watching\". IndieWire writer Wilson Chapman gave the film a B+, commending the animation, action sequences, characters, story, and voice acting. He concluded that \"[the film] probably won't have the same effect on most viewers, but it's one of the best films in the recent crop of anime TV expansions, and its bittersweet teen love story is certainly potent enough to make you cry.\" Rafael Motamayor of /Film wrote that the film was \"the best rom-com of 2025\".\n"
