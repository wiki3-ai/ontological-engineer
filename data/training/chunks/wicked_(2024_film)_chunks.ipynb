    "Wicked (titled on-screen as Wicked: Part I) is a 2024 American musical fantasy film directed by Jon M. Chu and written by Winnie Holzman and Dana Fox. It adapts the first act of the 2003 stage musical by Stephen Schwartz and Holzman, which was loosely based on Gregory Maguire's 1995 novel, a re-imagining of L. Frank Baum's 1900 novel The Wonderful Wizard of Oz and its 1939 film adaptation.\n",
    "Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande star as Elphaba Thropp and Glinda Upland, while Jonathan Bailey, Ethan Slater, Bowen Yang, Peter Dinklage, Michelle Yeoh, and Jeff Goldblum appear in supporting roles. Set in the Land of Oz before the events of The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, the film explores the early relationship between Elphaba, the future Wicked Witch of the West, and her schoolmate Galinda, who becomes Glinda the Good. \n",
    "Universal Pictures and Marc Platt, who both produced the stage musical, announced the film adaptation in 2012. After a long development and multiple delays, partly due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Chu was hired to direct, with Erivo and Grande cast in 2021. The adaptation was split into two parts to avoid omitting plot points and further develop the characters. Principal photography on both films began in England in December 2022, was interrupted in July 2023 by the 2023 SAG-AFTRA strike, and resumed and concluded in January 2024.\n",
    "Wicked premiered at the State Theatre in Sydney on November 3, 2024, and was released in the United States on November 22\n"

    "In the Land of Oz, Glinda the Good joins the citizens of Munchkinland as they celebrate the death of the Wicked Witch of the West. When asked whether wickedness is inherent or learned, Glinda explains that the Witch was the product of an affair between Governor Thropp's wife Melena and a mysterious traveling salesman. The salesman offered Melena a green elixir, causing the Witch to be born with green skin. Maligned from birth for her skin and impulsive use of magical powers, the Witch fostered a wish to meet the Wizard of Oz, the ruler of Oz famed for his power to grant wishes. When the Munchkins ask if Glinda was friends with the Witch, Glinda reflects on their relationship.\n",
    "Years earlier, green-skinned Elphaba Thropp escorts younger sister Nessarose on her first day at Shiz University. Nessarose's paraplegia causes the staff to patronise her, prompting an emotional outburst of Elphaba's powers. Shiz's Dean of Sorcery Studies, Madame Morrible, offers to enroll and privately tutor Elphaba in sorcery. She accepts, hoping she can fulfill her dream of working with the Wizard. Elphaba clashes constantly with her roommate, the popular Galinda Upland, who longs to become Morrible's student.\n",
    "Elphaba follows the history professor, Dr. Dillamond, a talking goat who faces discrimination as one of Shiz's last Animal professors, to a meeting of Animals off-campus. Learning the Animals are somehow losing their ability to speak, Elphaba assures Dillamond the Wizard will set it right\n"

Boq Woodsman, a Munchkin, asks Galinda to accompany him; to ensure she can attend with Fiyero, Galinda convinces him to invite Nessarose. Nessarose is overjoyed, and in thanks, Elphaba convinces Morrible to allow Galinda to study sorcery as well. When she is ridiculed at the Ozdust for wearing an ugly black hat gifted by Galinda as a practical joke, a remorseful Galinda dances with her and the two begin to bond.\n",
    "When Dillamond informs the class that Animals are no longer allowed to teach at Shiz, he is forcibly removed from the classroom and replaced by the unscrupulous Professor Nikidik who demonstrates a cage containing a frightened lion cub, designed to prevent Animals from learning to speak. Elphaba angrily spins poppy dust over the room, and escapes with Fiyero when the class falls unconscious. They release the cub into the forest and Elphaba laments her unrequited feelings for Fiyero, who has chosen Galinda.\n",
    "Elphaba receives an invitation from the Wizard, made aware of her powers by Morrible. She arrives in the Emerald City with Galinda, now calling herself \"Glinda\" in misguided solidarity with Dillamond, who constantly mispronounced her name.

They urge Elphaba to cast a levitation spell from the sacred Grimmerie, a spellbook that only powerful sorcerers can read and comprehend, causing the Wizard's monkey guards to painfully sprout wings. As the Wizard and Morrible rejoice over their newfound ability to use the monkeys as spies, Elphaba realizes that they are the ones behind the Animals' oppression and that the fraudulent Wizard, unable to read the Grimmerie and lacking real magic of his own, used her to subjugate them further. A horrified Elphaba seizes the Grimmerie and flees.\n",

Elphaba tries to escape the Emerald City in the Wizard's hot air balloon, but the way up is barred and the balloon burns up. High in a palace attic, Elphaba repeats the levitation spell on a broom. She urges Glinda to come with her, but Glinda chooses to remain behind. The two share an emotional farewell before Elphaba flies west.

Frank Baum's 1900 story The Wonderful Wizard of Oz. Other actresses who had expressed interest in adapting the novel included Whoopi Goldberg, Claire Danes, Salma Hayek, and Laurie Metcalf, and they had also been considered for the lead roles along with Michelle Pfeiffer, Emma Thompson, and Nicole Kidman. Woolverton had been hired to write the screenplay, and Robert Zemeckis was considered a potential director.\n",
    "However, by 1998, composer Stephen Schwartz successfully persuaded Universal and then-head of production Marc Platt to adapt the novel as a stage musical, with Winnie Holzman joining as scriptwriter. The musical, titled Wicked, opened on Broadway at the Gershwin Theatre in 2003. The fourth-longest-running Broadway show in history, the musical has won three Tony Awards. The original Broadway production starred Idina Menzel as Elphaba and Kristin Chenoweth as Glinda.\n",
    "In 2011, Universal began making plans for a film adaptation of the musical. Chenoweth, Menzel, Lea Michele, and Amy Adams were all rumored to be potential leads, Holzman and Schwartz were rumored as potential writers, and J. J. Abrams, Rob Marshall, James Mangold, and Ryan Murphy were all mentioned as possible candidates for director\n"

Daldry was reported considering Lady Gaga and Shawn Mendes for the roles of Elphaba and Fiyero. By 2024, Holzman was credited as the sole writer. In August 2024, it was determined by the Writers Guild of America that Dana Fox collaborated with Holzman on the screenplay and that Craig Mazin contributed additional literary material. Like the stage musical, the script includes made-up words such as \"braverism\", \"hideoteous\", and \"confusifying\", giving the Land of Oz its own \"Ozian\" language.\n",
    "In May 2017, Schwartz said Wicked would feature \"at least two\" new songs. On August 31, 2018, Universal put it on hold to accommodate its production schedule, and gave the film adaptation of Cats the release date formerly held by Wicked. On February 8, 2019, Universal announced a new release date of December 22, 2021. On April 1, 2020, Universal put Wicked on hold again due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and gave Sing 2 the 2021 release date. On October 20, 2020, it was announced that Daldry had left the production due to scheduling conflicts. On February 2, 2021, it was announced that Jon M. Chu would take over as director. In August 2021, Alice Brooks was confirmed as the cinematographer.\n"

    "In November 2021, Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande were cast as Elphaba and Glinda. Grande initially auditioned for Elphaba due to Chu being miscommunicated that she expressed interest in that role over Glinda. Grande had previously recorded \"Popular Song\" (a remix of \"Popular\") in 2012, and performed \"The Wizard and I\" in the 2018 NBC special A Very Wicked Halloween. Erivo had previously performed \"I Couldn't Be Happier\" (an excerpt from \"Thank Goodness\") in the 2021 PBS special Wicked in Concert. Grande revealed that she auditioned three times for the role of Glinda. She stated that she began taking acting lessons a year before her first audition, also adding that \"transforming [her] voice to sing Glinda's soprano parts took months\". Dove Cameron, Reneé Rapp, and Amanda Seyfried were also reported to have auditioned for Glinda.\n",
    "In June 2022, Chu confirmed the hiring of Nathan Crowley as production designer. On September 21, it was reported that Jonathan Bailey had joined the cast as Fiyero, beating, among others, Cooper Koch, Nick Jonas, and Joe Jonas for the role. In October 2022, it was announced that Jeff Goldblum was in final talks to star as the Wizard. Goldblum completed talks by December, when Ethan Slater, Michelle Yeoh, Marissa Bode, Bowen Yang, Bronwyn James, Keala Settle, Aaron Teoh, and Colin Michael Carmichael were also added to the cast. In April 2024, it was revealed that Peter Dinklage had been cast as the voice of Dr. Dillamond\n"

Erivo mentioned that she envisioned Elphaba's costume to incorporate \"a Jean Paul Gaultier collection with a 'new world, kind of gilded age' feeling\". Erivo also contributed to Elphaba's hair and nails: \"I knew I wanted [Elphaba] to have micro braids and I wanted her to have a full set [of nails] for two reasons: [they are] a nod to my culture and a nod to the world of Oz.\" She also stated: \"I imagined that her nails were a part of her magic — that they just grew out of her and she hadn't yet discovered why, like her green skin.\"\n"

Thus, he said, it was decided to split the story into two films; doing so would allow for more \"depth and surprise to the journeys for these beloved characters.\"\n",

    "New characters in Wicked include Miss Coddle; Dulcibear, Elphaba's childhood nanny; and Galinda's parents, who drop her off at Shiz University. Miss Coddle is the university's headmistress, previously Madame Morrible's role in the stage musical, with Morrible now the Dean of Sorcery. New scenes include Elphaba's tutoring sessions with Madame Morrible as she learns to control her powers, flashbacks to her childhood as she's ridiculed for her green skin, and moments showing her and Nessarose's dynamic as sisters. In the musical, Dr. Dillamond was the only Animal professor at Shiz; this is changed in the movie. The sexual content of the novel and the musical was toned down so both films could reach a wider audience and attain a PG rating from the Motion Picture Association (MPA). Pfannee, who was female in the novel and is cast as such in the musical, is portrayed as male in Wicked. In the musical, Elphaba is already enrolled at Shiz University alongside Nessarose; in the film, she is there to accompany and look after Nessarose at their father's request, before Morrible enrolls her later on. Elphaba and Fiyero's first meeting in Wicked happens in the forest, rather than with a group of classmates at Shiz University.\n",
    "The \"Something Bad\" sequence is changed from a conversation between Dr. Dillamond and Elphaba to a private meeting of the talking Animals at Dillamond's off-campus residence, where they sing to each other about the state of Oz\n"

In July 2022, it was revealed that rehearsals for Wicked would start in August, with principal photography beginning in November. On December 9, Chu confirmed on Twitter that filming had begun. Early into filming, paparazzi were seen flying over the Munchkinland set in Ivinghoe, England, by hang glider with GoPro cameras attached to their feet, in order to leak photos and videos from the set. Grande told VMan: \"I think we were very spoiled to have done this with [Chu]. It felt like a teeny, little secret student thing – it's intimacy... It felt so small and private until all of a sudden, we were outside, and the Daily Mail was hand gliding [sic] over our set\". Filming was scheduled to wrap in late July 2023. Shooting was suspended on July 13 due to the 2023 SAG-AFTRA strike. Filming resumed and concluded in January 2024, lasting for 155 days.\n",

    "The visual effects for Wicked were made by Industrial Light & Magic and Framestore, with Pablo Helman serving as the production visual effects supervisor. On February 6, 2024, it was confirmed that post-production work was in progress, with Chu working remotely with editor Myron Kerstein and editing with the newly released Apple Vision Pro. Throughout editing, Kerstein felt emotionally connected to Wicked and its story, particularly during post-production work on the Ozdust Ballroom and \"Defying Gravity\" sequences. Reflecting on the former scene, he stated: \"We always felt like the Ozdust Ballroom was basically the set piece we had to get right, because if that didn't work, the rest of the movie was going to fall apart.\" The sequence involved watching the entireties of every ten-minute-long take of Elphaba and Glinda's dance duet and picking the right portions that provoked the most emotional response. Editing on the entire film was done through Avid Media Composer.\n",
    "Wicked has 2,200 visual effects shots. Team Aspect handled the main-on-end title sequence and motion design, using 1930s stylization in homage to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer's film The Wizard of Oz (1939); this included a recreation of the Universal logo at the start, along with onscreen typography for the title and \"To be continued\" cards similar to the font used in The Wizard of Oz.\n"

    "Wicked was dubbed in several countries where local productions of the original musical were staged. Many of the dubs have actresses reprising their roles as Elphaba and Glinda after previously portraying them on stage, including Danna Paola and Ceci de la Cueva in Latin American Spanish, Myra Ruiz and Fabi Bang in Brazilian Portuguese, and Park Hye-na and Jeong Sunah in Korean. In the German dub, Elphaba was voiced by Sabrina Weckerlin, who was an alternate for the character in the original 2007 production. Johanne Milland, the voice of Glinda in Danish, portrayed the character in the 2024 production. Dutch actress Vajèn van den Bosch, who portrayed Elphaba in the German production in 2021, instead returned as Glinda in the Dutch dub.\n",
    "Additionally, certain local performers were brought in to dub Idina Menzel and Kristin Chenoweth's cameos. Willemijn Verkaik, who first played Elphaba in the original 2007 German production and again in several international engagements (including the original 2011 Dutch production, as well as the West End and Broadway in 2013), dubbed over Menzel in the Dutch and German versions, together with Chenoweth's dubbers and original Glinda actresses Chantal Janzen and Lucy Scherer. Maria Lucia Rosenberg, who portrayed Elphaba in the original 2011 Danish production, returned to dub Menzel in Danish\n"

    "The soundtrack album for Wicked was released on November 22, 2024, through Republic and Verve Records. The score album was released on December 6, 2024. Schwartz composed the score alongside John Powell. Jeff Atmajian updated William David Brohn's original orchestrations for the songs and enlarged the orchestra from the stage version's original 23 musicians to 80. The recording sessions took place at AIR Studios in London, with the musical's original music director Stephen Oremus conducting the song cues and Powell conducting the score cues alongside Gavin Greenaway, all with the London Symphony Orchestra. Schwartz, Oremus, and Greg Wells were the soundtrack's producers. A sing-along edition of the soundtrack was released on December 20, 2024. It features the original album's 11 tracks without lead vocals, but keeps the ensemble's vocals and some of the dialogue parts intact. On April 4, 2025, a new version of the soundtrack was released featuring spoken commentary on all songs by Wicked's cast and crew. Some songs from Wicked: For Good appear in the film, most prominently \"For Good\" in scenes showcasing Elphaba and Glinda's friendship.\n"

A Twitter user created their own edit, attempting to more accurately match the poster to the original artwork by obscuring Elphaba's eyes, raising Glinda's hand to cover her mouth, and giving Elphaba smirking red lips.

None of this is funny. None of it is cute. It degrades me. It degrades us. The original poster is an ILLUSTRATION. I am a real life human being, who chose to to [sic] look right down the barrel of the camera to you, the viewer ...because without words we communicate with our eyes. Our poster is an homage not an imitation, to edit my face and hide my eyes is to erase me. And that is just deeply hurtful.\n",
    "The user later deleted the post out of respect for Erivo, adding that their intentions were not malicious and they had not anticipated the reaction. However, on October 20, the user reposted their edit, saying while they felt Erivo's feelings were valid, they stood by the image as \"an innocent fan edit to pay homage to the original Broadway poster\". On October 19, Grande responded to the controversy, saying, \"I think it's very complicated because I find AI so conflicting and troublesome sometimes, but I think it's just kind of such a massive adjustment period... This is something that is so much bigger than us, and the fans are gonna have fun and make their edits... I have so much respect for my sister, Cynthia, and I love her so much.\" On October 29, Erivo was asked by Entertainment Tonight about the nature of her comments, and said that \"it wasn't necessarily a clapback..\n"

In December 2024, Mattel was sued by a mother in South Carolina, citing the emotional distress that she and her daughter had suffered due to the error. Consequently, Mattel issued a statement to some media outlets, indicating that the dolls had returned for sale with correct packaging and that \"the previous misprint on the packaging in no way impacts the value or play experience provided by the product itself in the limited number of units sold before the correction.\"\n"

That was followed by its premiere in Poland as the closing night film of the 32nd International Film Festival of the Art of Cinematography Camerimage on November 23, with cinematographer Alice Brooks and production designer Nathan Crowley (who received the 2024 Production Designer Award at the festival) in attendance. Advance screenings took place on November 18, 2024, for Amazon Prime members, and on November 20 for the general public. The two screenings marked the only times during the theatrical release that most theaters across the United States were simultaneously able to show it in IMAX, due to Gladiator II taking over most of those screens on opening weekend. A sing-along version was released theatrically on Christmas Day 2024.\n"

    "Wicked was previously scheduled for release on December 20, 2019, December 22, 2021, December 25, 2024, and November 27, 2024. The latter's release date was set to avoid competition with Avatar: Fire and Ash and Sonic the Hedgehog 3 (the former of which was later delayed to 2025 after Thunderbolts*, and later Mufasa: The Lion King took its date). It then moved forward to December 2 to avoid competition with Moana 2, with the new date putting it against Gladiator II. This triggered speculation about a scenario later termed \"Glicked\", similar to the Barbenheimer phenomenon which was a result of Barbie and Oppenheimer both being released on July 21, 2023. With Wicked released two weeks after the 2024 United States presidential election, Marc Platt reflected on the story's increasing relevance in the current political climate, saying, \"It's a significant election for both of us, but our story aspires to be about the distance people travel to connect with each other, about seeing the other as not the other, about living in a world where sometimes the truth is not real.\"\n",
    "Wicked was re-released in 100 North American theaters on June 4, 2025, with screenings accompanied by the \"fan first\" trailer premiere for Wicked: For Good. A second re-release took place from November 14–21, while a one-time double feature of Wicked and Wicked: For Good was released in select theaters on November 20.\n"

    "Tickets for Wicked went on sale on October 9, 2024, the day after Paramount Pictures released their tickets for Gladiator II. On October 10, Fandango reported that it was the site's number 2 first-day ticket pre-seller of 2024, behind Marvel Studios' Deadpool & Wolverine, as well as the best PG-rated first-day ticket pre-seller of the year and the number 3 best PG-rated first-day ticket pre-seller of all time, behind Frozen 2 and the 2019 remake of The Lion King (both from Disney). According to Deadline Hollywood, Quorum projected Wicked to gross $67–74 million in its domestic opening weekend, while Box Office Theory projected it would gross $96–150 million and Boxoffice Pro projected it would be $100–125 million, topping the box office ahead of Gladiator II. Initial skepticism was directed towards the notion that musical films post-pandemic would not be profitable. By the week of its release, projections were raised to a $165–200 million worldwide opening (and $125–150 million domestically), with positive word-of-mouth and the awards season buzz cited as the reasons.\n"

Actresses Carol Kane and Sheryl Lee Ralph, both of whom played Madame Morrible on Broadway, in Los Angeles, as well as touring productions of the musical, praised the film, with Kane saying \"Having done this show for years, it's sort of amazing that I was still bowled over by what I saw in the film.\" Mark Hamill, Paul Mescal, Ryan Reynolds, Kieran Culkin, Fernanda Torres, Millie Bobby Brown, Billie Eilish, and Taylor Swift expressed their admiration, with Hamill calling it an \"instant classic\".\n",
    "Elle UK's Panashe Nyadundu wrote that Wicked was a \"much-needed escape\" with a powerful message of kindness and acceptance that was warmly welcomed by audiences in the wake of the 2024 United States presidential election\n"

Nyadundu added: \"From LGBTQ+ representation, to shining a light on disabilities, animal rights, female friendship and more, Wicked not only offers escapism to a world of utter fantasy, but equally, acts as a sharp reminder of how to navigate a world marred by corruption and discrimination.\" In November 2024, a clip from an interview in which the journalist Tracy E. Gilchrist told Erivo and Grande that viewers were \"holding space\" for the lyrics of \"Defying Gravity\" went viral, creating multiple memes. Gilchrist later explained what she meant: \"For me, it means being in the moment, not being distracted and feeling something on a cellular level... I think you can hold space with lyrics of a song — one you've heard hundreds of times — and it can suddenly take on new meaning when you're a queer person.\"\n",
    "The choreography for \"What Is This Feeling?\" was recreated on TikTok and Instagram Reels by fans and the casts of various Broadway and West End productions. The widespread praise of the \"Defying Gravity\" scene led Avid to release a 14-minute video breakdown of Myron Kerstein's editing of the sequence on December 23, 2024, showing him analyzing his creative choices using the Media Composer timeline. Kerstein would later repeat this demonstration in person at the 2025 NAB Show on April 5, 2025, as part of a conversation panel with him and Alice Brooks.\n"
