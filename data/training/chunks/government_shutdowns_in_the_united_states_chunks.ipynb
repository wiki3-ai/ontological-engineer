    "In the United States, a government shutdown, officially known as a lapse in appropriations, occurs when funding legislation required to finance the federal government is not enacted before the next fiscal year begins. During a shutdown, the federal government curtails agency activities and services, ceases non-essential operations, furloughs non-essential workers, and retains only essential employees in departments that protect human life or property. Shutdowns can also disrupt state, territorial, and local levels of government.\n",
    "Funding gaps have led to shutdowns since 1980, when Attorney General Benjamin Civiletti issued a legal opinion requiring it. This opinion was not consistently adhered to throughout the 1980s, but since 1990, all funding gaps lasting longer than a few hours have resulted in shutdowns. As of November 2025, 11 funding gaps have led to federal employees being furloughed.\n",
    "The most significant historical shutdowns include the shutdown under Donald Trump's second presidency, which began on October 1, 2025, and lasted for 43 days;\n",
    "the 35-day shutdown of 2018–2019 during the first presidency of Donald Trump, over expanding barriers on the U.S.–Mexico border;\n",
    "the 21-day shutdown of 1995–1996 during the Bill Clinton administration, over opposition to major spending cuts;\n",
    "and the 16-day shutdown in 2013 during the Barack Obama administration, over implementation of the Affordable Care Act (ACA)\n"

    "Under the separation of powers created by the United States Constitution, the appropriation and control of government funds for the United States is the sole responsibility of the United States Congress. Congress begins this process through proposing an appropriation bill aimed at determining the levels of spending for each federal department and government program. The finalized version of the bill is then voted upon by both the House of Representatives and the Senate. After it passes both chambers, it proceeds to the President of the United States to sign the bill into law.\n",
    "The Antideficiency Act of 1870 makes it illegal for any government official to make payments or enter into contracts in excess of congressional appropriations. Although the Act was enacted in 1870, it was not until 1980 that the Department of Justice issued legal opinions interpreting the Act as requiring government shutdowns during funding lapses.\n",
    "Government shutdowns tend to occur when there is a disagreement over budget allocations before the existing cycle ends. Such disagreements can come from the president – through vetoing or threatening to veto any finalized appropriation bills they receive – or from one or both chambers of Congress, often from the political party that has control over that chamber\n"

A shutdown can be temporarily avoided through the enactment of a continuing resolution (CR), which can extend funding for the government for a set period, during which time negotiations can be made to supply an appropriation bill that all involved parties of the political deadlock on spending can agree upon.\n",
    "A CR can be blocked by the same parties if there are issues with the content of the resolution bill that either party has a disagreement with, in which case a shutdown will inevitably occur if a CR cannot be passed by the House, Senate or president. Congress may, in rare cases, attempt to override a presidential veto of an appropriation bill or CR. Such an act requires majority support of two-thirds of both chambers.\n",
    "Before 1980, many federal agencies continued to operate during shutdowns, while minimizing all nonessential operations and obligations, believing that Congress did not intend agencies to close while waiting for the enactment of annual appropriations acts or temporary appropriations. In 1980 and 1981, Attorney General Benjamin Civiletti issued two opinions that more strictly interpreted the Antideficiency Act in the context of a funding gap, along with its exceptions. The opinions stated that, with some exceptions, the head of an agency could avoid violating the Act only by suspending the agency's operations until the enactment of an appropriation\n"

    ". The 1981 opinion established that \"a government agency may employ personal services in advance of appropriations only when there is a reasonable and articulable connection between the function to be performed and the safety of human life or the protection of property.\" These opinions formalized the \"life and property exception\" that determines which federal employees are considered \"excepted\" and must continue working during shutdowns without pay. However, even after the Civiletti opinions, not all funding gaps led to shutdowns. Of the nine funding gaps between 1980 and 1990, only four led to furloughs.\n",
    "Members of Congress of both parties have proposed legislation to end the practice of government shutdowns, and bipartisan support has been strongest for automatic continuing appropriations at prior funding levels. One version would also require Congress and the Office of Management and Budget to remain in Washington, D.C., until new appropriations legislation is enacted, and September 2025 polling found 76% support for and 6% opposition to that approach.\n",
    "In practice, analysts and federal guidance distinguish between a \"full\" shutdown and a \"partial\" shutdown. In a full shutdown, none of the 12 annual appropriations are in force, and most federal government services cease, with some exceptions. In a partial shutdown, only some of the 12 bills have been enacted, so only unfunded departments and programs shut down\n"

    "While government shutdowns before 1995–1996 had very mild effects, a full federal government shutdown causes a large number of civilian federal employees to be furloughed. Such employees are forbidden even to check their e-mail, a prohibition that some agencies enforce by collecting government-issued electronic devices for the duration of the shutdown.\n",
    "Because of the size of the government workforce, the effects of a shutdown can be seen in macroeconomic data. During the 2013 shutdown, for example, 800,000 employees were locked out, payment was delayed to 1.3 million workers, confidence in the job market decreased for a month, and GDP growth slowed 0.1–0.2%. The loss of GDP was greater than it would have cost to keep the government open. Similarly, the 2018–19 shutdown reduced the level of GDP growth by 0.1% in the fourth quarter of 2018 ($3 billion in 2019 dollars) and by 0.2% in the first quarter of 2019 ($8 billion). Some of the loss could be recovered, but around $3 billion of real GDP (0.02% of real GDP of 2019) was estimated as unrecoverable.\n",
    "The complete effects of a shutdown are often clouded by missing data that cannot be collected while specific government offices are closed.\n",

    "On May 1, 1980, during the presidential term of Jimmy Carter, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) was shut down for one day after Congress failed to pass an appropriations bill for the agency. Before the shutdown, a review had been made of the 1884 Antideficiency Act regarding Congressional approval of agency funding. Initial opinion on the subject had been that this did not require a government agency to be closed down in the wake of the expiration of their funding, before Attorney General Benjamin Civiletti overruled this opinion with his own on April 25, 1980, stating that a provision of this act stipulated to the contrary. Five days later, the FTC was shut down after Congress delayed funding for the agency, in order to seek approval for an authorization bill to limit the agency's investigative and rule-making abilities, following criticism of the FTC's aggressive monitoring of the economy.\n",
    "The 1980 shutdown was the first time a federal agency shut down due to a budget dispute. Around 1,600 federal workers for the FTC were furloughed as a result, and Federal Marshals deployed to some FTC facilities to enforce their closure. The shutdown ended after one day when Carter threatened to close down the entire US government if Congress did not pass spending bills by October 1 later that year. Economists of the time estimated that the one-day shutdown of the FTC cost the government around $700,000, the majority of which was back-pay for the furloughed workers\n"

While the shutdown affected only a number of government departments, economists of the time believed that it cost taxpayers an estimated $80–90 million in back pay and other expenses over the entire day.\n",
    "The second shutdown occurred on the afternoon of October 4, 1984, with 500,000 federal employees placed on furlough during this period, after Reagan mounted opposition towards the inclusion of a water projects package and a civil rights measure within the proposed appropriations bill that day. The shutdown covered around nine of the 13 appropriations bills that had not been passed at that point. Congress was forced to remove both of the opposed elements of the bill and include funding of the Nicaraguan Contras as a compromise to end the shutdown\n"

    "The shutdown of 1990 occurred during the presidential term of George H. W. Bush and focused on a disagreement over several measures he proposed for the 1991 appropriations bill – the inclusion of major tax increases, despite Bush's campaign promise against any new taxes, and major cuts in spending towards benefit programs, including Medicare, to combat the deficit. On October 5, 1990, liberal Democrats and conservative Republicans, led by then House Minority Whip Newt Gingrich, opposed the initial appropriations package, with Bush vetoing the second resolution to the spending bill the following day on October 6.\n",
    "The shutdown lasted until October 9, when Bush agreed to remove his proposed tax increases and reduce the amount of spending cuts, in return for Congress providing a concession on the amended bill to allow for increasing income tax on the wealthy. The effects of the deadlock were lessened due to the fact that the shutdown occurred across the Columbus Day weekend – October 6 to 8. 2,800 workers were furloughed over this period. The national parks and museums, such as the Smithsonian, were closed, and a handful of departments unable to function. The cost to the government for lost revenue and back wages was estimated at $2.57 million.\n"

    "Between 1995 and 1996, the United States experienced two government shutdowns during Bill Clinton's presidency. They occurred after Clinton rejected 1996 spending bills proposed by congressional Republicans, who held majorities in both chambers, led by  House Speaker Newt Gingrich.\n",
    "Both Gingrich and the majority of Congress sought to pass bills that would reduce government spending, much against Clinton's political objectives for 1996. Clinton objected to funding cuts affecting education, the environment, and public health. One proposed bill threatened to block a scheduled reduction he had planned towards premiums within Medicare. Both sides had differing opinions over the impact the proposed House bills would have over economic growth, medical inflation, and anticipated revenues, with Clinton vetoing the bills over amendments added to them by congressional Republicans, despite Gingrich threatening to refuse to raise the country's debt ceiling.\n",
    "The first shutdown took place on November 14, 1995, after a CR issued on October 1 had expired, and meetings between Democratic and Republican leaders failed to end the deadlock. The effect of the deadlock led to the majority of government departments being closed down and 800,000 federal workers being furloughed as a result. Although the shutdown ended five days later on November 19, the political friction between Clinton and Gingrich over the US budget remained unresolved\n"

The shutdown was eventually ended on January 6, 1996, when White House and Congressional negotiators worked out a balanced budget agreement, which included approval towards modest spending cuts and tax increases.\n",
    "Both shutdowns had a contrasting impact on the major political players in the deadlock. Gingrich's political career was harmed by the shutdowns, in part due to a comment he made during the deadlock that made it sound like his reasons for it were petty. Clinton's presidential term was improved by the shutdown and cited as part of the reason behind his successful re-election to the White House in 1996.\n",
    "Some effects of the shutdowns included the government, tourism, and airline industry losing millions of dollars in revenue during this period, with disruptions made towards the processing of passports and visas, and work on medical research and toxic waste cleanup being halted.\n"

An attempt by Democrats to protect the payment of military personnel during the deadlock was rejected by Republicans, after then-Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell stated that funding had to be restored for the entire US government rather than for individual government branches. Despite the bill's failure, both sides engaged in negotiations that eventually culminated with a deal on a proposed stopgap measure to fund the government for four weeks – as part of the proposal, Democrats agreed to end their filibuster and approve the Republican's measure, in exchange for fresh talks on the DACA policy and DREAM Act within newly proposed Resolution bill. The measure was approved in the House and passed a Senate vote, effectively ending the shutdown on January 23.\n",

In the aftermath of the shutdown, the Senate debated on a bill for the 2018 Bipartisan Budget Act to provide 2-year funding for the military, and provide an extension to the Resolution to keep the government funded for another six weeks\n"

Democrats viewed the wall as a waste of money and likely ineffective, and instead proposed bills that would fund improvements in existing border security measures.

    "During the 2025 government shutdown, President Donald Trump planned to terminate approximately 4,100 probationary federal employees as part of a workforce reduction initiative. However, a federal judge in San Francisco temporarily blocked the layoffs, ruling that the planned firings were likely unlawful. The decision came after labor unions and nonprofit organizations filed lawsuits on behalf of the affected workers, arguing that the administration had bypassed standard legal procedures. The ruling underscored ongoing legal and political disputes over federal employment practices during the Trump administration.\n",
    "On October 17, 2025, federal workers missed their first full paycheck of the shutdown. By Day 20, approximately 750,000 workers were furloughed daily without pay, while 1.4 million essential workers continued working without paychecks. By October 31, the Congressional Budget Office estimated that the shutdown had caused an estimated $7 billion loss of output from the economy. More than 4,000 federal workers faced permanent layoffs.\n",
    "Military service members narrowly avoided missing their October 15 paycheck when the Pentagon redirected funds at the last possible moment. However, defense officials made clear they could not repeat this action, meaning the November 1 military payday was at risk\n"
