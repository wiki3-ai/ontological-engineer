    "Cher (  SHAIR; born Cheryl Sarkisian, May 20, 1946) is an American singer and actress. Dubbed the \"Goddess of Pop\", she is known for her androgynous contralto voice, bold fashion and visual presentation, and multifaceted career. Her screen roles often reflect her public image as a strong-willed, outspoken woman. An influential figure in popular culture, Cher has sustained a career spanning more than six decades through continual reinvention.\n",
    "Cher rose to fame in 1965 as part of the folk rock duo Sonny & Cher, whose hit single \"I Got You Babe\" became emblematic of 1960s counterculture. She simultaneously launched a solo career with moody pop songs such as \"Bang Bang (My Baby Shot Me Down)\", whose theatrical storytelling foreshadowed her 1970s US Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles \"Gypsys, Tramps & Thieves\", \"Half-Breed\" and \"Dark Lady\". After a period of acting, she released the hair metal albums Cher (1987), Heart of Stone (1989) and Love Hurts (1991), scoring international number-one hits \"If I Could Turn Back Time\" and \"The Shoop Shoop Song (It's in His Kiss)\". At 52, she released the dance-pop album Believe (1998), which introduced the \"Cher effect\"—a stylized use of Auto-Tune to distort vocals. Its title track became 1999's number-one song in the US and the UK's best-selling single by a female artist\n"

    "Cher became a TV star in the 1970s with The Sonny & Cher Comedy Hour and her solo variety show Cher, both on CBS, which drew more than 30 million weekly viewers. She later gained critical acclaim with her Broadway debut and the film adaptation of Come Back to the 5 & Dime, Jimmy Dean, Jimmy Dean (1982). Transitioning to film, she earned two Academy Award nominations—for Silkwood (1983) and Moonstruck (1987), winning Best Actress for the latter—and received the Cannes Film Festival's Best Actress Award for Mask (1985). Other starring roles include The Witches of Eastwick (1987), Mermaids (1990), If These Walls Could Talk (1996, her directorial debut), Tea with Mussolini (1999), Burlesque (2010) and Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again (2018).\n",
    "One of the best-selling music artists in history, Cher has sold over 100 million records and is the only solo artist with number-one singles on the US Billboard charts in seven consecutive decades (1960s–2020s). Her accolades include two Grammy Awards—including the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award—an Academy Award, a Primetime Emmy Award, three Golden Globe Awards, the Billboard Icon Award and the Kennedy Center Honors. She is the only performer to have won an Academy Award for acting and been inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame\n"

    "In 1951, Holt married actor John Southall, with whom she had Cher's half-sister, Georganne. Holt's marriage to Southall ended when Cher was nine; Cher later described him as her \"real father\" and a \"good-natured man who turned belligerent when he drank too much\". Holt remarried and divorced several times, frequently moving the family across states, including New York, Texas and California. They often struggled financially, and Cher recalled using rubber bands to hold her shoes together. While living in Los Angeles, Holt pursued acting while working as a waitress, occasionally securing minor TV roles for her daughters in shows such as The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet.\n",
    "By fifth grade, Cher organized a class performance of the musical Oklahoma!, taking on male roles when boys refused to participate. At nine, her voice was unusually low for a female child. Fascinated by film stars, Cher idolized Audrey Hepburn, particularly in Breakfast at Tiffany's (1961), emulating Hepburn's character's unconventional outfits and demeanor. She also admired Marlene Dietrich, Bette Davis and Katharine Hepburn, but felt discouraged by the lack of dark-haired actresses in Hollywood. She recalled, \"In the Walt Disney cartoons, all the witches and evil queens were really dark. There was nobody I could look at and think, 'That's who I'm like.'\" As a child, she dreamed of fame but struggled with feelings of inadequacy, describing herself as \"unattractive\" and \"untalented\"\n"

    "In 1961, Holt married bank manager Gilbert LaPiere, who adopted Cher (under the name Cheryl LaPiere) and Georganne and enrolled them at Montclair College Preparatory School, a private school in Encino. Coming from a modest background, Cher faced challenges in the upper-class environment, where, as biographer Connie Berman wrote, her \"striking appearance\" and \"outgoing personality\" set her apart. A former classmate recalled, \"I'll never forget seeing Cher for the first time. She was so special ... like a movie star, right then and there ... She said she was going to be a movie star and we knew she would.\" Known for her creativity and wit, Cher excelled in French and English but struggled with other subjects, later discovering she has dyslexia. Her unconventional behavior also stood out: she performed songs for students during lunch and surprised peers when she wore a midriff-baring top. Reflecting on her lack of focus in school, Cher said, \"I was never really [there]. I was always thinking about when I was grown up and famous.\"\n"

    "At 16, Cher left school and moved out of her mother's home to live with a friend. She took acting classes and supported herself by dancing in nightclubs along Hollywood's Sunset Strip, where she introduced herself to performers, managers and agents. According to Berman, Cher \"did not hesitate to approach anyone she thought could help her get a break\". She met Sonny Bono, 11 years her senior, in November 1962 while he was working for record producer Phil Spector. After her friend moved out, Cher accepted Sonny's offer to work as his housekeeper.\n",
    "Sonny introduced Cher to Spector, who used her as a backing vocalist on several recordings, including the Righteous Brothers' \"You've Lost That Lovin' Feelin'\" and the Ronettes' \"Be My Baby\". Spector also produced her first single, \"Ringo, I Love You\", released in early 1964 under the name Bonnie Jo Mason. Many radio programmers rejected the song, mistaking Cher's deep contralto for a male voice and assuming it was a gay man singing to the Beatles drummer Ringo Starr.\n",
    "Cher and Sonny became close friends, then lovers, and held an unofficial wedding ceremony in a hotel room in Tijuana, Mexico, on October 27, 1964. Although Sonny initially intended to launch Cher as a solo artist, she encouraged him to perform with her due to her stage fright, and he began joining her onstage to sing backing vocals\n"

    "In early 1964, Cher and Sonny recorded together for the first time, releasing \"The Letter\" as Caesar & Cleo on Vault Records. It featured inverted harmonies—Cher sang the lower part and Sonny the higher—a reversal of the typical male–female vocal roles they continued using in later recordings. Later that year, the duo signed a one-off deal with Reprise Records for another Caesar & Cleo single, \"Love Is Strange\". A week before its release, their managers reintroduced them to Reprise as a new act—Sonny & Cher—in an effort to secure a more lucrative contract. Unaware they were the same duo, Reprise released both singles simultaneously: \"Love Is Strange\" as Caesar & Cleo and \"Baby Don't Go\" as Sonny & Cher. Reprise declined a long-term deal after discovering the connection. While the Caesar & Cleo singles were commercially unsuccessful, \"Baby Don't Go\" found success in Los Angeles, prompting Atlantic Records to sign them to its Atco label.\n",
    "In late 1964, Cher signed a solo contract with Liberty Records' Imperial imprint, with Sonny as producer. The single \"Dream Baby\", released under the name Cherilyn, received airplay in Los Angeles. Encouraged by its early momentum, Imperial requested a follow-up. In summer 1965, she released a cover of Bob Dylan's \"All I Really Want to Do\", now credited as \"Chér\"\n"

As the two versions began competing on the charts, the Byrds' label shifted focus to promoting their single's B-side. Roger McGuinn of the Byrds recalled, \"We loved the Cher version ... We didn't want to hassle. So we just turned our record over.\" Cher's debut album, All I Really Want to Do (1965), reached number 16 on the US Billboard 200.

    "While launching her solo career, Cher continued recording with Sonny as a duo. Sonny & Cher's first Atco single, \"Just You\", failed to chart upon its release in April 1965. After recording \"I Got You Babe\", they traveled to England in July 1965 on the advice of the Rolling Stones. Cher recalled the Stones saying, \"Americans just didn't get us and that if we were going to make it big, we were going to have to go to England. According to writer Cintra Wilson, English newspaper photographers showed up when S&C were thrown out of the London Hilton [because of their outfits] the night they arrived—literally overnight, they were stars. London went gaga for the heretofore-unseen S&C look, which was neither mod nor rocker.\n"

    "\"I Got You Babe\" reached number one on the Billboard Hot 100 chart and became, according to AllMusic's Bruce Eder, \"one of the biggest-selling and most beloved pop/rock hits of the mid-'60s\". As the song displaced the Beatles at the top of the UK charts, English teenagers began emulating Sonny & Cher's fashion—bell-bottoms, striped pants and fur vests. According to Time's Ginia Bellafante, they became \"rock's 'it' couple\". After returning to the US in late 1965, the duo made their film debut with a cameo in Wild on the Beach (1965), appeared on teen-oriented TV shows such as Hullabaloo and Shindig! and toured major arenas across the country. Their concerts drew numerous Cher look-alikes, with girls straightening and dyeing their hair black and adopting her signature vests and bell-bottoms.\n",
    "Sonny & Cher's debut album, Look at Us (1965), spent eight weeks at number two on the Billboard 200, behind the Beatles' Help!. Cashbox magazine described Sonny & Cher, the Beatles and the Rolling Stones as \"global stars\" whose success in both the US and UK showed that national origin was no longer a barrier to international stardom. Despite the dominance of the British Invasion and Motown, the duo emerged as major chart competitors\n"

    "Sonny committed the duo to a feature film in 1965 during their commercial peak, and production on the musical Good Times ran through 1966. As the press circulated studio stills throughout that year, their public image moved away from the bohemian look that had defined their early success. Journalists viewed their new Hollywood-oriented presentation as out of step with the youth culture they had once symbolized. Their monogamous lifestyle during the sexual revolution, along with their anti-drug stance amid widespread drug use, further distanced them from the counterculture. Bego later wrote that \"in spite of their revolutionary unisex clothes, Sonny and Cher were quite 'square' when it came to sex and drugs.\"\n",
    "Directed by William Friedkin, Good Times was released in May 1967 and failed commercially at a moment when their record sales were already sliding. By early 1968 the duo's singles had stopped charting. Berman observed that the \"heavy, loud sound\" of newer acts such as Jefferson Airplane and Cream made their folk rock seem \"too bland\". Cher later said she \"loved\" the electric guitar-driven style of Led Zeppelin and Eric Clapton and wanted to adapt, but Sonny refused.\n",
    "Cher's fifth studio album, Backstage (1968), which explores a range of styles including bossa nova and anti-war protest songs, did not chart. In 1969, Cher was dropped by Imperial Records, and Sonny & Cher were dropped by Atco. Atco then offered Cher a solo deal\n"

Decades later, AllMusic called it \"the finest album of her career\" and \"still a revelation\". Displeased with the album, Sonny blocked Cher from releasing further recordings for Atco.\n",
    "Meanwhile, Sonny dated others and by the end of the 1960s their relationship had begun to unravel. According to People, Sonny \"tried desperately to win her back, telling her he wanted to marry and start a family.\" They officially married after Cher learned she was pregnant, and she gave birth to Chaz Bono on March 4, 1969. In an effort to regain their young audience, the duo spent $500,000 and mortgaged their home to make the film Chastity (1969). Written and produced by Sonny, it tells the story of a young woman, played by Cher, searching for the meaning of life. The art film failed commercially, putting the couple $190,000 in debt with back taxes. Some critics noted that Cher showed acting potential; Cue magazine wrote, \"Cher has a marvelous quality that often makes you forget the lines you are hearing.\"\n",
    "At the lowest point in their career, the duo developed a nightclub act with a more adult sound and style. According to writer Cintra Wilson, \"Their lounge act was so depressing, people started heckling them. Then Cher started heckling back. Sonny ... reprimanded her; then she'd heckle Sonny\"\n"

    "CBS head of programming Fred Silverman offered Sonny and Cher their own TV program after he noticed them as guest-hosts on The Merv Griffin Show in 1971. The Sonny & Cher Comedy Hour premiered as a summer replacement series on August 1, 1971 and had six episodes. Following its ratings success, the couple returned that December with a full-time show.\n",
    "Watched by more than 30 million viewers weekly during its three-year run, The Sonny & Cher Comedy Hour was praised for the comedic timing, as a deadpan Cher mocked Sonny about his looks and short stature. According to Berman, they \"exuded an aura of warmth, playfulness and caring that only enhanced their appeal. Viewers were further enchanted when a young [Chaz] appeared on the show. They seemed like a perfect family.\" Cher honed her acting skills through comedy sketches, including her original character Laverne LaShinsky, a brash and over-the-top housewife, while her Bob Mackie-designed outfits set 1970s fashion trends.\n",
    "In 1971, Sonny and Cher signed with the Kapp Records division of MCA Records and Cher released the single \"Classified 1A\", in which she sings from the point of view of a soldier who bleeds to death in Vietnam. Written by Sonny, who felt that her first solo single on the label had to be poignant and topical, the song was rejected by radio station programmers as uncommercial.\n"

    "Since Sonny's first attempts at reviving their recording career as a duo had also been unsuccessful, Kapp Records recruited Snuff Garrett to work with them. He produced Cher's second US number-one single, \"Gypsys, Tramps & Thieves\", which \"proved that ... Garrett knew more about Cher's voice and her persona as a singer than Sonny did\", wrote Bego. \"Gypsys, Tramps & Thieves\" was the first single by a solo artist to rank number one on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart at the same time as on the Canadian singles chart. It was featured on the 1971 album Chér (later reissued under the title Gypsys, Tramps & Thieves), which was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Its second single, \"The Way of Love\", reached number seven on the Billboard Hot 100 chart and established Cher's more confident sound as a recording artist.\n",
    "In 1972, Cher released the all-ballad album Foxy Lady, demonstrating the evolution of her vocal abilities, according to Bego. Following its release, Garrett quit as producer after disagreeing with Sonny about the kind of material Cher should record. At Sonny's insistence, Cher released the standards album Bittersweet White Light (1973), which was commercially unsuccessful. Later that year, lyricist Mary Dean brought Garrett \"Half-Breed\", a song about the daughter of a Cherokee mother and a white father, which she had written for Cher\n"

She was also required to work exclusively for Sonny's company, leaving her with no career or financial control. Record executive David Geffen, with whom Cher had begun a relationship in 1973, helped her break free from the contract. Cher won custody of Chaz after a highly publicized legal battle, and their divorce was finalized on June 26, 1975. Geffen hoped to marry Cher, but she ended the relationship due to his possessiveness and struggles with his sexuality.\n",

Cher without Sonny ... could be the best thing that's happened to weekly television this season.\" Musical guests included David Bowie (in his American TV debut), Ray Charles, Elton John, Bette Midler, Tina Turner and the Jackson 5, with Billboard crediting Cher for bringing \"a rock sensibility to prime-time TV\".\n",

Richard Seeley of the Daily Breeze praised the album as \"an important link between the rock and roll subculture and the mass popular music audience\", noting that Cher showed \"real talent\" by choosing lesser-known rock songwriters over \"surefire hit makers like John [Lennon] and [Paul] McCartney\". In contrast, Janet Maslin of The Village Voice argued that she lacked rock credibility, writing that \"image, not music, is Cher Bono's main ingredient for both records and TV.\" Though Stars was a commercial failure, it later developed a cult following and has been regarded as one of her best works.\n"

She filed for divorce nine days later due to his heroin and alcohol problems, but they reconciled within a month. Their son, Elijah Blue Allman, was born on July 10, 1976. Cher's TV reunion with Sonny, The Sonny and Cher Show, debuted on CBS in February 1976—the first show ever to star a divorced couple. Although it premiered to strong ratings, their biting onscreen banter about the divorce along with her troubled relationship with Allman sparked a public backlash that contributed to the show's cancellation in August 1977.\n",

Under pressure from Warner Records to return to her earlier narrative pop style, Cher recorded her 13th and 14th studio albums, I'd Rather Believe in You (1976) and Cherished (1977), neither of which charted. Orange Coast writer Keith Tuber suggested that her weekly TV shows may have hurt record sales by giving audiences regular access to her music\n"

Reviews were largely negative: Larry Rohter of the Houston Chronicle called I'd Rather Believe in You \"atrocious\", citing \"dreary vocals\" and describing it as \"one of the lamest records of the year\", while Christine Brown of the Miami Herald wrote of Cherished, \"It might help to stare at the album cover as you listen ... It takes your mind off what you're hearing.\"\n",
    "In 1977, under the rubric Allman and Woman, Cher and Allman recorded the duet album Two the Hard Way. The couple toured Europe to support the album, though audience reception was mixed. With a combination of Cher fans and Allman Brothers fans in attendance, fights frequently broke out at venues, prompting Cher to cancel the tour. Their relationship ended soon after the tour's cancellation, and their divorce was finalized in 1979. In 1978, Cher began a two-year live-in relationship with Kiss member Gene Simmons. She briefly returned to prime-time TV with the specials Cher... Special (1978)—featuring a segment in which she performs all of the roles in her version of West Side Story—and Cher... and Other Fantasies (1979).\n"

Temporarily setting aside her desire to be a rock singer, she signed with Casablanca Records and launched a comeback with the single \"Take Me Home\" and the album of the same name, both of which capitalized on the disco craze. The album and single became instant successes, remained bestsellers for more than half of 1979 and were certified gold by the RIAA. The album's sales were likely enhanced by the image of a scantily clad Cher in a Viking outfit on its cover.\n"

    "Encouraged by the popularity of Take Me Home, Cher sought a return to rock with her 16th studio album, Prisoner (1979). The album cover, showing her naked and draped in chains, symbolized her struggle as a \"prisoner of the press\" amid intense tabloid scrutiny. The imagery drew criticism from feminist groups for her perceived portrayal of a sex slave, while critics found the album's mix of rock and disco tracks inconsistent, contributing to its commercial failure. The single \"Hell on Wheels\", featured on the soundtrack of the film Roller Boogie (1979), reflected Cher's personal embrace of the late 1970s roller-skating craze, which she had helped popularize. Cher collaborated with Giorgio Moroder to write \"Bad Love\", her final Casablanca disco track, for the film Foxes (1980).\n",
    "In 1980, Cher formed the rock band Black Rose with guitarist and then-partner Les Dudek. To blend in and avoid overshadowing the group with her celebrity status, she adopted a punk-inspired look, cutting her signature long hair. Although she was the lead singer, she chose not to take top billing to present the band as equal. Despite TV appearances, the band struggled to book concerts. Their album, Black Rose, received poor reviews; Cher told Rolling Stone that critics \"didn't attack the record, they attacked me\n"

    "During Black Rose's run, Cher was also performing a residency at Caesars Palace, Las Vegas, with two shows nightly, seven days a week, earning $300,000 weekly. Beginning in June 1979 and running until 1982, the residency evolved into Cher's first solo tour, the Take Me Home Tour, with dates in North America, Europe, South Africa and Australia. Described by The Press of Atlantic City as \"the biggest cabaret act ever seen on any stage\", the concert series yielded two TV specials: Standing Room Only: Cher in Concert (1981) and Cher... A Celebration at Caesars (1983), the latter earning her the CableACE Award for Best Actress in a Variety Program. In 1981, Cher collaborated with Meat Loaf on the duet \"Dead Ringer for Love\", which peaked at number five on the UK singles chart and was praised by AllMusic's Donald A. Guarisco as \"one of the more inspired rock duets of the 1980s\". The following year, Cher released the new wave album I Paralyze, a commercial failure and her only album under Columbia Records.\n"

    "With declining record sales and radio airplay, Cher shifted her focus to acting. Despite earlier aspirations, her only film credits, Good Times and Chastity, were critical and commercial failures, and Hollywood did not take her seriously as an actress. Reflecting on this period, Cher said, \"I was dropped by my [label] and couldn't get a job ... [so] I went to Las Vegas\", which she likened to an \"elephant's graveyard\" for fading stars. Despite her success performing there, she felt unfulfilled: \"I was making a fortune ... but I was dying inside.\"\n",
    "In 1982, Cher moved to New York to study acting with Lee Strasberg at the Actors Studio, but skipped enrollment after auditioning for and being cast in Robert Altman's Broadway production Come Back to the 5 & Dime, Jimmy Dean, Jimmy Dean. Co-starring with Karen Black and Sandy Dennis, she played a James Dean fan club member at a 20-year reunion, earning unexpectedly positive reviews. Frank Rich of The New York Times praised her \"cheery, ingratiating nonperformance\" as a refreshing contrast in a dull ensemble, suggesting the play needed more of her and less of her co-stars. Altman later cast her in the film adaptation of the same title.\n"

By 1988, Cher had become one of the most bankable actresses of the decade, commanding $1 million per film.

Jon Bon Jovi, Michael Bolton, Richie Sambora and Desmond Child produced her first Geffen album, Cher.

Her 19th studio album, Heart of Stone (1989), reached number one in Australia and entered the top 10 in Canada, New Zealand, the UK and the US, where it was certified triple platinum. The album yielded three US top-ten singles: \"After All\" (with Peter Cetera), \"Just Like Jesse James\" and \"If I Could Turn Back Time\". The latter spent seven weeks at number one in Australia, became one of her signature songs and drew controversy for its sexually suggestive music video, filmed aboard the battleship USS Missouri. Cher launched the Heart of Stone Tour in 1989, which continued through 1990. Critics praised the tour for its nostalgic appeal and her showmanship. The TV special Cher..\n"

    "In the early 1990s, Cher contracted the Epstein–Barr virus and developed myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome, leaving her too exhausted for music or film projects. She declined leading roles in Thelma & Louise and The War of the Roses. Her next film appearances were cameos in Robert Altman's The Player (1992) and Prêt-à-Porter (1994). To generate income, she appeared in infomercials for health, beauty and diet products, earning nearly $10 million. Critics saw it as a sellout and speculated her film career was over, with Entertainment Weekly stating she had eroded her \"hard-won A-list actress status\". The ads were parodied on Saturday Night Live and referenced in Clueless (1995), where protagonist Cher Horowitz jokes she was named after a \"great [singer] of the past who now does infomercials\". Cher later reflected, \"Suddenly I became the Infomercial Queen ... people stripped me of all my other things.\"\n"

Later that year, Cher published The First Time, a collection of autobiographical essays of \"first-time\" events in her life. Critics praised the book as sincere and relatable.

She co-headlined the TV special VH1 Divas Live '99, which drew 19.4 million viewers and became the highest-rated program in VH1's history at the time. Her Do You Believe? Tour (1999–2000) sold out in every American city it visited, drawing a global audience of over 1.5 million. The tour's TV special, Cher: Live in Concert – From the MGM Grand in Las Vegas (1999), became HBO's top-rated original program of 1998–1999. Billboard named Cher the top dance artist of 1999. Capitalizing on her success, former label Geffen released the US-only compilation If I Could Turn Back Time: Cher's Greatest Hits (1999), certified gold by the RIAA. Meanwhile, Cher oversaw The Greatest Hits (1999) for international markets, reaching number one on the European Top 100 Albums chart.\n",
    "In 2000, Cher released Not Commercial, an album she wrote after attending a songwriting conference in 1994. She chose the title after her label's chief dismissed the project as \"nice, but not commercial\" and rejected it for its explicit language and unsparing themes, including the suicide of Kurt Cobain, homelessness, veteran neglect and personal trauma. She sold it independently on her website, an unusual move for an artist under contract with a major label\n"

Initially met with mixed reviews and modest box office results, the film was later reassessed; Entertainment Weekly called it \"a campy, niche classic [that] inspired everything, from drag queen revues to viral internet moments\". Her ballad \"You Haven't Seen the Last of Me\", from the soundtrack, topped the Billboard Dance Club Songs chart in January 2011, making her the only artist with Billboard number-one singles in six consecutive decades (1960s–2010s). After voicing Janet the Lioness in Zookeeper (2011), she produced the documentary Dear Mom, Love Cher (2013). It follows her efforts to support her mother Georgia Holt's dream of becoming a singer, culminating in the release of Holt's debut album at age 87.\n",
    "Closer to the Truth (2013), Cher's first studio album since 2001's Living Proof, debuted at number three on the Billboard 200—her highest position on that chart to date—and reached the top 10 in Canada, Germany, Scotland and the UK. The Boston Globe wrote that \"Cher's 'Goddess of Pop' sash remains in little danger of undue snatching; at 67, she sounds more convincing than J-Lo or Madonna reporting from 'the club'\"\n"

Director Ol Parker addressed casting Cher as Streep's mother despite their three-year age difference by stating, \"Cher exists outside of time.\" Critics highlighted her performance as a standout, with Vulture remarking, \"Every single movie ... would be infinitely better if it included Cher.\" For the soundtrack, she recorded two ABBA songs, \"Fernando\" and \"Super Trouper\". Björn Ulvaeus of ABBA commented, \"She makes 'Fernando' her own\n"

Her 26th studio album, Dancing Queen (2018), debuted at number three on the Billboard 200, tying with 2013's Closer to the Truth as her highest-charting solo album in the US. With first-week sales of 153,000 units, it achieved the year's largest sales week for a pop album by a female artist. Dancing Queen received widespread critical acclaim; Rolling Stone wrote that Cher makes the ABBA songs sound as if they were written for her, and Entertainment Weekly called it her \"most significant release since 1998's Believe\".\n"

    "Cher's Here We Go Again Tour ran from 2018 until its indefinite postponement in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic lockdowns. Rolling Stone deemed the tour proof that Cher \"can wipe the floor with any pop star from any generation\". The Cher Show, a jukebox musical with three actresses playing Cher at different stages of her life, premiered in Chicago in June 2018 and ran on Broadway from December 2018 to August 2019, later touring the UK, Ireland and the US. On December 2, 2018, Whoopi Goldberg presented Cher with the Kennedy Center Honors for her \"extraordinary contributions to culture\", with tribute performances by Adam Lambert, Cyndi Lauper and Little Big Town. In 2019, she launched Cher Eau de Couture, a \"genderless\" follow-up to her 1988 fragrance Uninhibited.\n",
    "During the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, Cher focused on projects that could be completed from home. In May, she released her first Spanish-language song, a cover of ABBA's \"Chiquitita\", with proceeds donated to UNICEF. Later that year, she voiced a bobblehead version of herself in Bobbleheads: The Movie and joined the charity supergroup BBC Radio 2 Allstars for a cover of Oasis' \"Stop Crying Your Heart Out\". The recording, made in support of the Children in Need charity, became a UK top-ten single\n"

    "In the late 2010s and early 2020s, Cher collaborated with major fashion brands. After attending the 2015 Met Gala as Marc Jacobs' guest, Cher became the face of his Fall/Winter campaign. She then starred alongside rapper Future in Gap's Fall 2017 campaign, followed by Dsquared2's Spring/Summer 2020 campaign, MAC Cosmetics' \"Challenge Accepted\" campaign in January 2022 and UGG's \"Feel\" campaign the same month. For Pride Month in June 2022, Cher partnered with Versace to launch the \"Chersace\" capsule collection, with proceeds benefiting the LGBTQIA+ charity Gender Spectrum. In September 2022, she walked the runway at Paris Fashion Week, closing Balmain's Spring/Summer 2023 show, and in November, she starred in the brand's \"Balmain Blaze\" campaign. That month, Cher confirmed she was dating music executive Alexander Edwards, 40 years her junior. Their age gap sparked criticism online, which she addressed by tweeting, \"Love doesn't know math.\" Cher's mother, Georgia Holt, died in December 2022 at the age of 96.\n"

She received her first nomination two months later and was inducted on October 19, 2024, becoming the first performer to have won an Academy Award for acting and been inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Cher decided to accept the honor out of admiration for her fellow inductees. At the ceremony, she performed \"If I Could Turn Back Time\" and \"Believe\", the latter as a duet with Dua Lipa.\n",

A federal judge ruled that the royalties were a separate contractual obligation and ordered her to pay Cher around $418,000 in withheld earnings. In September, Cher withdrew a conservatorship petition over her son Elijah, originally filed in December 2023 due to concerns about his ongoing substance abuse. The court had earlier denied her requests for temporary control, citing Elijah's demonstrated ability to manage his affairs. The matter was resolved privately.\n",

    "Cher has explored diverse musical styles, including rock (folk, punk, arena and pop subgenres), soul, jazz, disco, new wave, power ballads, hip hop and electronic dance music, aiming to \"remain relevant and do work that strikes a chord\". Music historian Annie Zaleski wrote in Cher's Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction essay that she sings \"nearly every style of music\" effortlessly. Cher's music often centers on heartbreak, independence and women's empowerment, making her a \"brokenhearted symbol of a strong but decidedly single woman\", according to Out's Judy Wieder. Goldmine's Phill Marder credited Cher's musical success to her \"nearly flawless\" song selection, noting that while Sonny Bono contributed to early hits, most of her solo successes came from independent songwriters she chose. Her 2000 album Not Commercial, largely self-written, has a \"1970s singer-songwriter feel\" that highlights her storytelling skills, according to AllMusic's Jose F. Promis.\n"

None, however, reflected the authority and command that we associate with rock 'n' roll today as much as [Cher's] key early hits\". Some of Cher's early songs discuss subjects rarely addressed in American popular music such as divorce, prostitution, unplanned and underaged pregnancy, and racism. According to AllMusic's Joe Viglione, the 1972 single \"The Way of Love\" is \"either about a woman expressing her love for another woman or a woman saying au revoir to a gay male she loved\". Her ability to carry both male and female ranges allowed her to sing solo in androgynous and gender-neutral songs.\n",
    "Cher's contralto voice has been praised for its distinctiveness. Ann Powers of The New York Times described it as \"a quintessential rock voice: impure, quirky [and] a fine vehicle for projecting personality.\" Zaleski called her timbre \"recognizable, dusky and sultry, like exquisite black velvet\", with a wide range and \"warbling\" vibrato. AllMusic's Bruce Eder stated that her voice's \"intensity and passion\" are amplified by her acting skills, creating \"an incredibly powerful experience for the listener\". The Guardian's Laura Snapes called her voice \"miraculous\", capable of expressing \"vulnerability, vengeance and pain\" simultaneously\n"

    "Writing about Cher's musical output during the 1960s, Hilburn stated that \"no one matched the pure, seductive wallop of Cher\". By contrast, her vocal performances during the 1970s were described by Eder as \"dramatic, highly intense ... [and] almost as much 'acted' as sung\". First heard in the 1980 record Black Rose, Cher employed sharper, more aggressive vocals on her hard rock-oriented albums, establishing her sexually confident image. For the 1995 album It's a Man's World, she restrained her vocals, singing in higher registers and without vibrato.\n",
    "Cher's 1998 song \"Believe\" was the first commercial recording to use Auto-Tune—an audio processor for correcting off-key vocals—as a stylistic effect, creating a robotic, futuristic sound. Cher, who proposed the effect, faced resistance from her label but insisted it remain, saying, \"You can change [the song] over my dead body\". Dubbed the \"Cher effect\", the technique was later described by Pitchfork's Simon Reynolds as having \"revolutionized the sound of popular music\" and as \"the sound of the 21st century\". Cher used Auto-Tune extensively on Living Proof (2001) and later albums.\n"

    "Maclean's magazine's Barbara Wickens described Cher as \"probably the most fascinating movie star of her generation\", highlighting her \"magnetic\" screen presence and her ability to be both \"boldly shocking\" and \"ultimately enigmatic\". Film Comment wrote, \"For Cher is a star. That is, she manages the movie star trick of being at once a character and at the same time never allowing you to forget: that's Cher.\" New York Post critic David Edelstein attributed Cher's \"top-ranking star quality\" to her capacity for projecting \"honesty, rawness and emotionality\", adding that she \"wears her vulnerability on her sleeve\". New York magazine's David Denby pointed to her distinctive appearance as a key factor in her appeal, describing her look as \"odd, a bit oriental and snaky\" and suggesting that it aligns with \"the traditional definition of a Hollywood star—that you always want to see more\".\n",
    "Author Yvonne Tasker noted that Cher's film roles mirror her public image as a rebellious, sexually autonomous and self-made woman. She often portrays women who help marginalized male characters navigate mainstream society. This perception was reinforced in The X-Files episode \"The Post-Modern Prometheus\" (1997), which follows a scientist's grotesque creature who idolizes Cher because of her role in Mask (1985), where her character cares for her disfigured son\n"

    "Cher's music videos and live performances have frequently reflected her public image, addressing themes such as self-construction, female sexuality and the pursuit of perfection. Her concerts often include biographical montages and self-referential visuals. Author Diane Negra described them as multimedia retrospectives that merge different phases of her career into a cohesive stage narrative and frame performance as a form of autobiography. The New York Times observed that Cher's onstage appearances alongside projected images of her younger selves function to reaffirm and reclaim earlier identities, while the Los Angeles Times described her shows as rooted in \"her larger-than-life story [and] mythology of self-reinvention\".\n",
    "In her 1991 Cher... at the Mirage concert video, she subverted the typical staging of female pop performances by replacing female backup dancers with a male dancer impersonating her. Dressed in a replica of her 1986 Academy Awards outfit, the impersonator initially appeared to be Cher. Cher then emerged in a different costume and began performing, while the impersonator interacted with oversized props symbolizing fame and media attention. Negra interpreted this segment as Cher casting herself as the narrator of her own life story, using the impersonator to emphasize her status as a \"fictionalized production\" shaped by media and performance—a dynamic she described as offering audiences a \"pleasurable plurality\"\n"

In 1967, she caught the attention of then-Vogue editor Diana Vreeland at a party for Jacqueline Kennedy and began modeling for photographer Richard Avedon. She appeared five times as the cover model for US Vogue.\n",

Cher had first worn the gown to the 1974 Met Gala. According to André Leon Talley of Vogue, \"it was really the first time a Hollywood celebrity attended and it changed everything. We are still seeing versions of that look on The Met red carpet 40 years later.\" Billboard wrote that Cher has \"transformed fashion and [become] one of the most influential style icons in red carpet history\".\n",

She became a sex symbol through her TV shows, wearing inventive and revealing Mackie-designed outfits and successfully fighting network censors to bare her navel.

    "Cher's signature hairstyle, known as \"the Cher hair\"—long, straight, jet-black hair parted in the center—was a 1970s fashion trend that saw multiple revivals in later decades. In the 1970s, she started wearing wigs on her TV shows to play various characters in the same episode. By the 1990s, wigs became a staple of her public appearances, enabling her to experiment with colors and lengths. She has stated that wigs help her \"stay current\" while protecting her natural hair. Professor Katrin Horn from University of Greifswald wrote that Cher's use of wigs has surpassed typical celebrity fashion, elevating her into \"the realms of feminine drag\".\n",
    "Cher has six tattoos. The Baltimore Sun called her the \"Ms. Original Rose Tattoo\". She got her first tattoo in 1972. According to Sonny Bono, \"Calling her butterfly tattoos nothing was like ignoring a sandstorm in the Mojave. That was exactly the effect Cher wanted to create. She liked to do things for the shock they created.\" In the late 1990s, she began having laser treatments to remove her tattoos. She commented, \"When I got tattooed, only bad girls did it: me and Janis Joplin and biker chicks. Now it doesn't mean anything. No one's surprised.\"\n",
    "Cher was the inspiration for Mother Gothel, a fictional character who appears in Walt Disney Pictures' animated feature film Tangled (2010)\n"

    "Cher is revered by the LGBTQ community, a status attributed to her career accomplishments, distinctive style and enduring longevity. Many of her songs are considered gay anthems, including \"If I Could Turn Back Time\", \"Believe\", \"Strong Enough\" and \"Song for the Lonely\". She is regarded as a gay icon and is frequently imitated by drag queens. According to Salon writer Thomas Rogers, drag queens emulate figures like Judy Garland, Dolly Parton and Cher because they \"overcame insult and hardship on their path to success\"—narratives that resonate with the struggles many gay men face when coming out.\n",
    "Maclean's journalist Elio Iannacci stated that Cher was \"one of the first to bring drag to the masses\", hiring two drag queens to perform with her during her Las Vegas residency in 1979. The Advocate's Jeff Yarbrough described Cher as \"one of the first superstars to 'play gay' with compassion and without a hint of stereotyping\", as she portrays a lesbian in the 1983 film Silkwood. Cher's social activism has further solidified her status as a gay icon. As the mother of a trans man, Chaz Bono, Cher has advocated for visibility and support for trans families.\n",
    "Cher's influence on LGBTQ culture was highlighted in the NBC sitcom Will & Grace, where she was the idol of gay character Jack McFarland. She appeared as herself in two episodes, including \"Gypsies, Tramps and Weed\" (2000)—referencing her 1971 song \"Gypsys, Tramps & Thieves\"—which became the show's second-highest-rated episode\n"

Music critic Jeff Miers credited Cher with setting the template for generations of female pop artists, citing her mastery of theatrical presentation, seamless genre shifts and knack for provoking without losing mainstream appeal. According to The New York Times, Cher \"earned her mononym\" and inspired \"an entire industry of imitators, both figurative and literal\". Shon Faye of Dazed wrote that her legacy underpins many modern pop stars: \"If Madonna and Lady Gaga and Kylie Minogue and Cyndi Lauper were playing football, Cher would be the stadium they played on and the sun that shone down on them.\" Rob Sheffield of Rolling Stone called her \"the one-woman embodiment\" of pop music. Cher has been referred to as the \"Goddess of Pop\" in publications such as The Washington Post, Time and Billboard.\n",
    "Cher's career has been marked by continual reinvention; Richard Aquila described her as \"the ultimate pop chameleon\", while The New York Times dubbed her the \"Queen of the Comeback\". The Atlantic's Sophie Gilbert wrote, \"Decades before Madonna had reinventions and Taylor Swift had eras, Cher had comebacks—triumphs over decline in which she'd reemerge stronger, shinier, and more resolute than ever.\" Cher remarked, \"It's a thousand times harder to come back than to become\n"

Author Craig Crawford described Cher as \"a model of flexible career management\", highlighting how she adapted her image to align with cultural trends while maintaining a rebellious persona that made her transformations both strategic and authentic.

    "Cher's sustained success in a male-dominated entertainment industry has invited discussion around gender roles and autonomy in entertainment. Billboard credited her with establishing an \"androgynous musical identity\" that predated and influenced artists such as David Bowie and Patti Smith. Goldmine's Phill Marder said Cher advanced \"feminine rebellion\" in 1960s rock, calling her \"the prototype of the female rock star\". Billboard described her as a \"pioneer of female autonomy\" in the music industry, as her unconventional themes—including racism and prostitution—challenged expectations for female artists in a \"male-driven\" era. Marder tied this perception of autonomy to her commanding, \"near dominatrix\" stage persona alongside Sonny Bono and her rise to greater prominence as a solo act.\n",
    "Early in her career, Cher's critics often framed her output as an extension of male collaborators, a view Cher addressed directly: \"It was a time when girl singers were patted on the head for being good and told not to think\". Over time, her image evolved, reflecting what professor Yvonne Tasker described as her ambition to build an acting career \"on her own terms\" by rejecting both \"dependence on a man [and] the conventional role assigned to women [over 40] in an industry that fetishises youth\"\n"

    ". AllMusic noted that during her popular 1970s TV shows with Sonny Bono, \"he was a diminutive foil to Cher's sexually provocative comedienne\", reversing traditional gender dynamics and positioning her as the comedic lead. Director George Schlatter credited Cher with redefining women's roles in TV comedy, stating, \"Until Cher, women have been the joke, not done the joke ... She's the first female star to carry a show in the same way that men have\".\n",
    "Following her 1988 Academy Award win, The New York Times' Stephanie Brush compared Cher's impact on women to Jack Nicholson's cultural appeal among men, stating that she embodied women's \"revenge fantasies\" by confronting those who underestimated her: \"You need to be more than beautiful to get away with this. You need to have been Cher for 40 years.\" Later that year, Ms. magazine praised her as an \"authentic feminist hero\" and \"the quintessential woman of the '80s\", emphasizing her refusal to conform to expectations of feminine decorum—both in appearance and behavior. It cited her flamboyant self-presentation, her public confrontations with David Letterman, TV censors and patronizing film directors, as well as her candor about single motherhood, younger partners, cosmetic surgery and her struggle to be taken seriously as a rock singer and actress. A 1996 Dateline NBC interview clip featuring Cher's response to her mother's advice to \"marry a rich man\"—\"Mom, I am a rich man\"—went viral in 2016\n"

    "Cher's public image—marked by defiance, flamboyance and an unwavering sense of self—has itself become a subject of cultural study and popular fascination. Gilbert described Cher as \"a walking, singing eye roll [who] has never met an obstacle without theatrically raising a middle finger.\" In Rolling Stone, Jancee Dunn noted her enduring coolness, attributing it to her refusal to conform: \"Her motto is, 'I don't give a shit what you think, I'm going to wear this multicolored wig.'\" Alexander Fury of The Independent described her celebrity as \"seemingly immortal\" and operating at a \"omnipotent, uni-monikered level\", while Frank Bruni of The New York Times wrote that she personifies \"a magnitude of celebrity for which the word fame is pathetically insufficient\". Bego emphasized her multifaceted career: \"No one in the history of show business has had a career of the magnitude and scope of Cher's. She has been a teenage pop star, a television hostess, a fashion model, a rock star, a Broadway actress, an Oscar-winning movie star, a disco diva and the subject of a mountain of press coverage.\" Lynch concluded, \"The world would certainly be different if she hadn't stayed so irrevocably Cher from the start.\"\n"

    "Cher has advocated for recognition of the Armenian Genocide. At the 2016 premiere of The Promise, a war film depicting the genocide, she criticized Turkey's denial and highlighted the general public's lack of awareness. She cited the Obersalzberg Speech and the line, \"Who, after all, speaks today of the annihilation of the Armenians?\" She also discussed her Armenian heritage and her grandparents' survival of the genocide. Cher expressed support for Armenia and Artsakh on Twitter during the 2020 Nagorno-Karabakh war. The following year, she congratulated Joe Biden for being the first US President to formally recognize the Armenian Genocide.\n",
    "In September 2020, Cher raised nearly $2 million for Biden's presidential campaign at a virtual LGBTQ-themed fundraiser. In October, she campaigned for Biden in Nevada and Arizona and released a cover of \"Happiness Is a Thing Called Joe\", originally from the 1943 musical Cabin in the Sky, with lyrics updated to be about Biden. In 2022, following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Cher voiced support for Ukraine on Twitter and called for humanitarian aid. She referred to Russian President Vladimir Putin as a despot seeking to restore the Soviet Union and announced plans to provide shelter to Ukrainian refugees in her home. In October 2024, Cher endorsed the presidential ticket of Kamala Harris and Tim Walz, stating on social media that Harris was \"fighting for all of us\" and would \"protect our rights\".\n"

During the COVID-19 pandemic, Cher launched the CherCares Pandemic Resource and Response Initiative (CCPRRI) alongside Dr. Irwin Redlener, the head of Columbia University's Pandemic Resource and Response Center, to distribute $1 million to \"chronically neglected and forgotten people\" through the Entertainment Industry Foundation (EIF). Cher told Billboard, \"There are rural areas where people of color and Latinos and Native Americans were getting no services. It's not a lot of money—$1 million goes in the blink of an eyelash!—so now I'm trying to get my friends to make it a lot more so we can do something that will really meet people's needs.\"\n",

That same year, she co-founded Free the Wild, an international charity dedicated to protecting wild animals in captivity. In 2020, Free the Wild partnered with Four Paws International, prompting Cher to travel to Pakistan to advocate for and work with the country's government for the transfer of Kaavan, an elephant confined to a zoo for 35 years, to a wildlife sanctuary in Cambodia\n"

    "Cher's older child, Chaz Bono, first came out as a lesbian at age 17, which reportedly caused Cher to feel \"guilt, fear and pain\". She later accepted Chaz's sexual orientation and came to the conclusion that LGBTQ people \"didn't have the same rights as everyone else, [and she] thought that was unfair\". Cher was the keynote speaker for the 1997 national Parents, Families, & Friends of Lesbians and Gays (PFLAG) convention and has since become one of the LGBTQ community's most vocal advocates. In May 1998, she received the GLAAD Vanguard Award for having \"made a significant difference in promoting equal rights for lesbians and gay men\". On June 11, 2009, Chaz came out as a transgender man and his transition from female to male was legally finalized on May 6, 2010.\n"
