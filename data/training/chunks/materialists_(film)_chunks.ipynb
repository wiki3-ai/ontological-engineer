    "Failed actress turned successful matchmaker Lucy Mason works at Adore, a matchmaking company in New York City. An \"eternal bachelorette,\" she maintains she will either die alone or marry someone wealthy. Despite her professional success, Lucy grows frustrated with her clients' increasingly unrealistic standards. Her long-term client Sophie is struggling to lower her standards and settle while Lucy consoles her over her recent rejection.\n",
    "Lucy attends a former client's wedding, the ninth she has been responsible for. The bride is crying, feeling she is marrying for shallow reasons and out of obligation, but Lucy ultimately persuades her to proceed with the ceremony. At the wedding reception, Lucy is approached by financier Harry Castillo, the groom's brother, who overhears Lucy's business pitch to other singles at the party. He shows interest in her, but she rebuffs him, suggesting instead that he become an Adore client. Also at the wedding is Lucy's ex-boyfriend John Pitts, who is working as a cater-waiter and continues to pursue acting. They reminisce about their past relationship, which ended due to differing financial aspirations.\n",
    "Harry persists in courting Lucy, taking her to upscale restaurants. She initially questions his interest, believing he could find a better partner, but he reassures her that his interest is genuine\n"

    "Lucy's confidence is shaken when her boss, Violet, informs her that Sophie is suing Adore because Mark assaulted her after the date. Violet tells Lucy that the situation was out of her hands, orders her to take four weeks off to clear her mind and instructs her not to contact Sophie due to the lawsuit. Despite Violet's warning, Lucy tracks Sophie down and personally apologizes. Sophie angrily rejects the apology, calling her a \"pimp\" who was looking to pawn off a problem client on any man she could, regardless of the consequences. She storms off, further increasing Lucy's guilt.\n",
    "Preparing to travel to Iceland with Harry, Lucy finds an engagement ring in his luggage. Later that night, she discovers he had undergone a $200,000 tibial lengthening surgery to increase his height. Adamant that the procedure changed his life for the better, he asks her if it changes her feelings for him. While it does not, Lucy realizes they are both pursuing the relationship simply because they \"check the boxes\" of what each is seeking in a partner, but are not actually in love. They amicably break up.\n",
    "As Lucy had sublet her apartment because of the trip, she visits John, who suggests they travel upstate with money he earned from his play. At a wedding they gatecrash together, she kisses him\n"

John confesses he has always loved her and envisions a future together despite his insecurity for not being able to provide the relationship she wanted, while Lucy admits that her dissatisfaction with John's financial situation overshadowed their love when they were together and assumes that John hates her, which he denies.\n",
    "Lucy receives a panicked call from Sophie; Mark is outside her apartment and the police are refusing to intervene since he has not broken in. Lucy and John rush back to the city, finding that Mark has already left. Lucy helps Sophie file a restraining order and they reconcile. Before parting, John appeals to Lucy to rekindle their relationship, promising to remind himself every day that he loves her and work harder to support their relationship.\n",
    "Later, it is revealed through a phone call from Violet that Sophie begins dating a new match from Adore; Harry has also become a client. Violet, who is needed to handle another branch, offers Lucy a promotion to lead the New York office. Lucy reveals that she intended to resign but agrees to consider the offer. In Central Park, John proposes with a flower ring and asks whether she wants to make a bad financial decision together, and Lucy accepts. The credits depict various couples, including Lucy and John, receiving marriage licenses at the city clerk's office.\n"

    "On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 78% of 291 critics' reviews are positive. The website's consensus reads: \"A mature deconstruction of the conventional rom-com, Materialists provides its trio of swoon-worthy stars some of their meatiest material yet while reaffirming Celine Song as a modern master of relationship dramas.\" Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 70 out of 100, based on 50 critics, indicating \"generally favorable\" reviews. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"B–\" on an A+ to F scale, while those surveyed by PostTrak gave it a 69% positive score.\n",
    "Christy Lemire of RogerEbert.com described the film as \"clear-eyed, even as it makes the happily-ever-after seem possible after all,\" praising its performances and character depth. In Variety, Owen Gleiberman wrote that the film offers \"sharp and serious social romantic drama\" and commended its \"telling observations about the way we live now.\"\n",
    "Entertainment Weekly's Maureen Lee Lenker called the film a \"sly, yet charming romance,\" likening Celine Song's work to Jane Austen's in terms of its cultural wit and romantic nuance\n"
