    "The film begins with a message that it's based on true events that happened in Bhatta and Parsaul villages of Gautam Buddha Nagar district in Uttar Pradesh in 2011.\n",
    "In the District and Sessions Court of Bikaner, Rajasthan, poet and farmer Rajaram Solanki from Parsaul village, loses possession of his mortgaged agricultural land to local developer Raghunath Bharadwaj, for failing to repay dues. His widowed daughter-in-law Varsha tries to raise the point that the papers of the deal have been forged, but is brushed aside as a woman. A broken Rajaram writes a poem lamenting how he wanted to bequeath his land to his now-dead son, and his misfortune as a farmer. He then commits suicide by drowning himself.\n",
    "A few years later, both versions of 'Jolly'—Meerut's Jagdish Tyagi and Kanpur's Jagdishwar Mishra—are now practising as advocates in Delhi's Sessions Court. Their common nickname often leads to one losing clients to another, leading to physical fights. When an NGO working for farmers' rights sends the case of Parsaul's 40 protesting farmers to Tyagi, he purposely diverts them to Mishra as revenge, knowing they did not bring much with them. When he tries to do the same to Janki, Rajaram Solanki's widow who had approached Tyagi's wife and NGO worker Sandhya, Mishra takes her to the Tyagi residence. Sandhya convinces Tyagi to fight the case pro bono.\n",
    "Parsaul's farmers are protesting the acquisition of their land for industrialist Haribhai Khaitan's 'Bikaner to Boston' project\n"

    ". Khaitan has an understanding with local MLA Iqbal Singh Shekhawat and DM Avik Sengupta. To nullify Tyagi and Janki's case without drawing too much media attention, Khaitan's right-hand man Shrivastav hires Jolly Mishra. The case reaches the court of Justice Sunderlal Tripathi, who flies into a rage after seeing both versions of Jolly in his courtroom (having known them from the first and second films). Mishra wins the case and has Janki's complaint dismissed, prompting Khaitan to invite him to his party and hire him for future cases.\n",
    "Janki visits Mishra's residence and confronts him with her story. Khaitan had earlier visited Parsaul and tried to settle the conflict over Rajaram's suicide and villagers' opposition to land acquisition, by handing over a compensation cheque to Janki. Her public refusal of the money had scandalised Khaitan, and he tried to get back at her by spreading rumours about an extramarital affair between Rajaram and Varsha, leading to the latter hanging herself. Mishra is ashamed and, after a talk with his wife Pushpa, decides to side with Janki against Khaitan. As a symbolic gesture, the two Jollys disrupt a car race on the 'Bikaner to Boston' project's new racetrack using camels.\n",
    "Tyagi manages to have the case reopened after the 40 Parsaul villagers who had earlier consulted Mishra, join Janki as co-complainants. Khaitan and Shrivastav fly in renowned lawyer Vikram Ray Chaudhary from London to represent their company\n"

    ". As the two Jollys bicker, their case appears to crumble, but Justice Tripathi allows them time to correct their affidavits before he passes a final order. When an attendant privately points out the partiality towards the Jollys in this decision, Justice Tripathi reminds him that the spirit of the law is as important as the letter, and the duo deserve time as honest lawyers.\n",
    "The district administration under DM Sengupta tries to force the issue on the ground by using police force on Parsaul. Tyagi and Mishra advise the villagers to remain calm and non-violent, but a shooter sent by MLA Shekhawat fires at Sengupta to give police a reason to attack the villagers. Mishra pursues him, but the shooter is shot and killed before capture. Tyagi is injured and hospitalised, and the violence leads to 9 fatalities and multiple injuries and hospitalisations.\n",
    "On the final hearing day in court, Vikram makes a powerful speech noting how industrialists like Khaitan must be supported by the judiciary if India has to unlock its potential and become rich and developed. He claims that Khaitan has used his own hard-earned money to provide avenues for the country's growing middle class to enjoy luxuries. For progress of the nation, he argues, some people have to make sacrifices\n"

    ". Mishra counters him by exposing how most of Khaitan's projects are financed through loans from nationalised banks, and how economic expert Milind Desai's report on the 'Boston to Bikaner' project is biased, since his firm prepares reports almost exclusively for Khaitan's company. He also explains how Khaitan uses small developers like Bharadwaj to defraud indebted farmers like Rajaram Solanki, acquiring land dirt cheap and selling it at a premium. Tyagi then enters the courtroom with a witness—a seriously injured Sengupta, whom Tyagi met while in the hospital, who testifies that he received bribes from Khaitan, and the bullet removed from his body came from Shekhawat's registered rifle. Tyagi concludes his argument by showing Khaitan, Vikram, and Justice Tripathi pictures of their homes and saying that they need to be demolished for progress, asking why only the poor and vulnerable like Rajaram and Janki, should always be the people making sacrifices for the nation, rather than the rich and influential like Khaitan and Vikram.\n",
    "Justice Tripathi delivers his verdict, ruling that Khaitan's land purchases for the project are illegal due to multiple violations of the Land Acquisition Act. He also orders a judicial inquiry into the circumstances of Rajaram and Varsha's suicides, and the violence in Parsaul. The film ends with Tyagi and Mishra celebrated by the villagers, the slogan of Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan, and asks viewers to thank a farmer when they have their next meal.\n"

    "The Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC) gave the film a U/A certificate with a 16+ rating and asked for some modifications to be made for certain dialogues and visuals. The film briefly faced a dispute with PVR INOX over the Virtual Print Fee (VPF). While the producers maintained that an existing agreement exempted its films from such charges, PVR INOX allegedly sought a payment of approximately ₹3.5 crore shortly before release and temporarily halted advance bookings. The issue was resolved after the producers agreed to the payment and ticket sales were subsequently restored. The film was theatrically released on 19 September 2025 with the same date for North America and International release by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures through their 20th Century Studios label. \n",
    "Multiple public interest litigations (PILs) were filled against the film, alleging that its trailer and the song \"Bhai Vakeel Hai\" mocked the judiciary and defamed the legal profession. However, the Allahabad High Court dismissed a plea to stay the film’s release, stating that it found nothing objectionable in the lyrics or trailer, while the Bombay High Court also rejected a similar petition, observing that judges are accustomed to criticism and not affected by satire. The Madhya Pradesh High Court issued notices over the song but no ban was imposed, and overall the courts held that the complaints did not meet the threshold of defamation or contempt.\n"
