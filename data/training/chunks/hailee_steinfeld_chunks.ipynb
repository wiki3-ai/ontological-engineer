    "Steinfeld began acting at age 10; she appeared in several short films, including playing the role of Talia Alden in the award-winning She's a Fox. Steinfeld was chosen for the role of Mattie Ross in True Grit when she was 13. The film was released internationally in December 2010; Richard Corliss of Time magazine called her performance one of the Top 10 of 2010, and wrote that Steinfeld \"delivers the orotund dialogue as if it were the easiest vernacular, stares down bad guys, wins hearts. That's a true gift\". Reviews from Roger Ebert, the Los Angeles Times, and Rolling Stone were also complimentary. The role earned Steinfeld a nomination at the 83rd Academy Awards for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress; it went to Melissa Leo. In May 2011, five months after True Grit was released, she was chosen to be the new face of Italian designer brand Miu Miu.\n"

Variety writer Natalie Weiner stated that Steinfeld has long been injecting \"some vague notion of female empowerment [...] into her music. Self-love is a common theme Steinfeld has looked at within her music.\n",
    "Steinfeld has stated that she hopes to be remembered as \"an artist that truly cared about the art\". She went on to note the \"differences between working on a film set and in a studio are multiple\", and adding that \"she loves the freedom of making music\".\n",

    "There's something so freeing about going into a studio. It doesn't matter what time of day it is, doesn't matter what you're wearing or whether you're wearing make-up or not. You go into a room with people that you love and you feel comfortable with, and can be yourself around and be vulnerable and open up and talk about experiences. Magic happens in those moments.\n"

    "Steinfeld endorsed a variety of charities, including numerous organizations with a focus on improving children's lives. The list of charities endorsed by her includes: \"What's Your Mission?\", a charitable initiative with mission apparel and an accessories brand, \"No Kid Hungry\", a charity working to eradicate child hunger in the United States, WE Movement, The Ryan Seacrest Foundation, Make-A-Wish Foundation, and others. On the set of True Grit, Steinfeld created a \"swear jar\"; every time someone uttered the word \"fuck\", Steinfeld would collect $5 from the perpetrator, while other vulgarities were worth a dollar. As a trade-off, she had to pay up 50 cents if she said \"like\". She stated she \"matched it and donated it all to an Alzheimer's foundation\".\n",
    "Steinfeld has made several public appearances during charity events, such as the Breast Cancer Foundation's 2014 Hot Pink Party, the iHeartRadio Jingle Ball 2015 tour, and WE Day 2019 in California. In 2016, Steinfeld participated in singing \"Santa Claus Is Coming to Town\" with fellow singers and celebrities. The single raised money to aid New York City's homeless during the holiday season through \"Robin Hood\", a New York City organization that focuses on fighting poverty.\n",
    "Steinfeld alongside the cast of the Pitch Perfect film series reunited to record an a cappella cover of Beyonce's track \"Love On Top\", which was released in August 2020\n"
