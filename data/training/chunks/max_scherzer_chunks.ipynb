    "Maxwell Martin  Scherzer (born July 27, 1984), nicknamed \"Mad Max\", is an American professional baseball pitcher who is a free agent. He has previously played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Arizona Diamondbacks, Detroit Tigers, Washington Nationals, Los Angeles Dodgers, New York Mets, Texas Rangers and Toronto Blue Jays. A right-handed starting pitcher, Scherzer is an eight-time MLB All-Star, has won three Cy Young Awards, has pitched two no-hitters, and is a two-time World Series champion, winning with the Nationals in 2019 and the Rangers in 2023. He is regarded as one of the best pitchers in baseball history.\n",
    "The Arizona Diamondbacks selected Scherzer with the 11th overall pick of the 2006 amateur draft. He made his MLB debut with the Diamondbacks in 2008. In December 2009, Scherzer was traded to the Detroit Tigers. During his five-year tenure in Detroit, Scherzer made the American League All-Star Team twice and won the 2013 American League Cy Young Award. Scherzer also helped the Tigers win four consecutive American League Central titles from 2011 to 2014. In 2015, Scherzer became the fifth pitcher in Major League history to record multiple no-hitters in a single season. On May 11, 2016, in a game against the Tigers, he tied the major league nine-inning single-game strikeout record with 20, making him the second player to achieve both a no-hitter and 20 strikeouts over nine innings. In that same game, Scherzer became the youngest pitcher to beat all 30 MLB teams\n"

    ". Scherzer won the NL Cy Young Award in 2016 and 2017, and made the National League All-Star Team five times with the Nationals.\n",
    "In the 2019 World Series, against the Houston Astros, Scherzer earned a win in Game 1, and started Game 7, which the Nationals also won (Scherzer received a no-decision) for their first World Series championship. Scherzer was traded to the Dodgers in 2021 where they reached the 2021 NLCS, and he finished 3rd in NL Cy Young voting. As a free agent, he signed with the Mets and was named to the All-MLB Team at the conclusion of the 2022 season. Midway into the 2023 season, Scherzer was traded to the Rangers, where he started Games 3 and 7 of the 2023 ALCS against the Astros, and Game 3 of 2023 World Series as the Rangers won their first championship.\n",
    "Scherzer is the fifth pitcher to start an All-Star Game for both the American and National Leagues. He is a four-time wins leader and a winner of three strikeout titles. One of the most consistent hurlers of his era, he made at least 30 starts each season from 2009 to 2018 and struck out at least 230 batters in each season from 2012 to 2019. In 2017, he became the third-fastest player ever to record 2,000 career strikeouts and the fourth to strike out 250 or more in four consecutive seasons. Scherzer recorded more wins (161) and strikeouts (2,452) than any pitcher in the 2010s. He joined the 3,000 strikeout club on September 12, 2021, and has struck out the 11th most all-time\n"

    "Scherzer was born and raised in the St. Louis suburb of Chesterfield, Missouri, the son of Jan (Shirck) and Brad Scherzer, and grew up a St. Louis Cardinals fan. He played baseball, football, and basketball as a student at Parkway Central High School, which is in his hometown. What he lacked in raw talent, he made up for with the fiercely competitive nature that distinguished his athletic career. One of his high school coaching influences was basketball coach Rick Kirby, who stressed fundamentals and was defense-oriented. Marty Maier, then the Cardinals' scouting director, selected him in the 43rd round (1,291st overall) of the 2003 Major League Baseball (MLB) draft. However, he did not sign and instead attended the University of Missouri in Columbia.\n"

    "Early in his time at Missouri, Scherzer exerted so much effort in his windup that his head whip constantly caused his cap to fall off. One of Scherzer's coaches at Missouri, Tony Vitello, had helped to recruit him, and eventually persuaded him to pitch with more balance and control and to stop leaping at hitters, which frequently caused him to miss up and in to right-handed batters. He did not pitch the final 50 days of his freshman season, choosing instead to focus on working out and doing long toss, while gaining velocity in the process. Vitello and head coach Tim Jamieson trained him in a drill to balance on his back leg with more coordination and not to fall over his front foot. Scherzer modified his delivery and worked constantly over the following winter, leading to a 1.86 earned run average (ERA) and 131 strikeouts in 106 innings pitched over 16 games during his sophomore season.\n",
    "After his freshman year at the University of Missouri in 2004, Scherzer played with the La Crosse Loggers of the Northwoods League (NWL), a collegiate summer baseball league. He went 2–1 that summer with a 1.91 ERA with six saves. He also struck out 50 batters in only 33 innings pitched. He was named a mid-season All-Star.\n",
    "As a sophomore with Missouri in 2005, Scherzer won the Big 12 Pitcher of the Year Award.\n",
    "On January 9, 2012, it was announced that Scherzer would be inducted into the University of Missouri Intercollegiate Athletics Hall of Fame.\n"

Instead, Scherzer began his professional baseball career with the Fort Worth Cats of the independent American Association. He stated that \"It was my decision\" and \"I've never second guessed it.” He appeared in only three games for the Cats, in which he pitched a total of 16 innings, earning a 1–0 record with 25 strikeouts and an ERA of 0.56.\n",

    "Scherzer began playing in the Diamondbacks organization with the Class A Advanced Visalia Oaks. In his first start on June 7 with the team, he struck out 8 and allowed just one run on 2 hits over five innings. The following start, Scherzer pitched seven perfect innings and had 13 strikeouts. He did not finish the game due to a pitch limit, but told reporters he believed he “would have gotten the perfect game if I had stayed in.”\n",
    "Scherzer pitched just one more start for the Oaks before being promoted to the Double-A Mobile BayBears at the end of June that year. With the BayBears, he posted a 3.91 ERA over 14 starts while striking out 76 in 73 2/3 innings.\n",

    "On April 29, 2008, Scherzer made his MLB debut against the Houston Astros when he came on in relief and struck out the first batter he faced, Jack Cassel. He threw 41⁄3 perfect innings while striking out seven. In the process he set the record for the number of consecutive batters retired (13) for a pitcher making his MLB debut as a reliever. The previous record was 12 set in 1962 by the Los Angeles Dodgers' Pete Richert. The seven strikeouts that he had in the appearance were one short of the MLB record for most in a debut relief appearance. The Pittsburgh Pirates' Barry Jones had eight on April 20, 1986.\n",
    "On April 30, 2008, the Diamondbacks announced he would be part of the starting rotation, due to his impressive debut. In his first appearance as a starter for the D-Backs, Scherzer allowed five runs (two earned) in four innings, while striking out five, taking the first loss of his major league career. He returned to the bullpen for much of the 2008 season. For the season, he was 0–4 with a 3.05 ERA in 16 games (seven starts) and struck out 66 batters in 56 innings.\n",
    "Scherzer participated in the 2008 Arizona Fall League season as a member of the Phoenix Desert Dogs.\n"

Scherzer was tied for the most strikeouts in Comerica Park history with Jeremy Bonderman, and tied for second in franchise history behind Mickey Lolich, who had 16 strikeouts in one game. On July 26, Scherzer and Tampa Bay Rays pitcher Matt Garza dueled for a no-hitter into the sixth inning. After 5+2⁄3 hitless innings, Scherzer lost the no-hit bid, shutout, and game after serving up a grand slam to Matt Joyce. Meanwhile, Garza opportunely secured the no-hitter in a 5–0 Tampa win. Scherzer struck out eight.\n",
    "On September 1 against the Minnesota Twins, Scherzer pitched into the ninth inning for the first time in his career. He gave up one run on four hits and one walk while striking out nine on 107 pitches, though he received a no-decision as the Tigers lost the game in the tenth inning.\n",
    "Scherzer finished the 2010 season with a 12–11 record, 3.50 ERA, and 184 strikeouts. Despite spending some time in the minor leagues, his strikeout total was still good for tenth in the American League.\n"

Scherzer gave up the go-ahead run in the top of the inning, but the Tigers regained the lead in the bottom of the frame. Then he loaded the bases with no outs in the top of the eighth but wriggled out of trouble by striking out Josh Reddick and Stephen Vogt, then he got Alberto Callaspo to line out to center field. The Tigers won the game, and Scherzer earned the victory to go to 2–0 in the series.\n",

In Game 2, he no-hit Boston for 5+2⁄3 innings before surrendering two hits and a run in the bottom of the sixth. He left the game with a 5–1 lead after seven innings, striking out 13. However a quartet of Tiger relievers blew the lead in the eighth inning on a grand slam by David Ortiz, and Boston won it, 6–5, on a walk-off single in the ninth. Scherzer was the losing pitcher in the Tigers' 5–2 loss in Game 6, the deciding and final game of that series.\n"

On June 14, 2015, he pitched his second career complete game, ceding one hit and one walk in a 4–0 shutout against the Milwaukee Brewers at Miller Park. He accrued six perfect innings before Carlos Gómez, leading off the seventh inning, fought off a 96 miles per hour (154 km/h) fastball for a bloop single to right field inches past the outstretched glove of second baseman Anthony Rendon. Scherzer's 16 strikeouts established a new personal best and a Nationals team record for one game, surpassing Stephen Strasburg's effort of 14 versus the Pittsburgh Pirates on June 8, 2010.

    " Several baseball analysts and pundits debated the game as one of the greatest pitching performances of all time, and perhaps the most dominant no-hitter ever pitched, based on the number of strikeouts, lack of walks issued or hit batters, and sheer mastery of the opposing batting order the third time through the lineup. At one point, Scherzer had struck out nine consecutive Mets, just one shy of the Major League record set by Tom Seaver in 1970. It tied Nolan Ryan for most strikeouts in a no-hitter, was the first no-hitter produced with at least 17 strikeouts and no walks, and made Scherzer the sixth pitcher in MLB history to record multiple no-hitters in one season. With a game score of 104, it was the second-highest achieved on record and made Scherzer the first to achieve multiple game scores of at least 100 in the same season. That game won the 2015 Esurance MLB Award for Best Performance.\n",
    "Because of his three most brilliant performances that season, Scherzer became the first to assemble three-game scores of 97 or higher in one season since at least 1914. Ryan and Walter Johnson (1918) were the only two other pitchers to carry out three-game scores of 95 or more in one season\n"

    "On May 11, 2016, Scherzer struck out 20 Detroit Tiger batters, to tie the record for strikeouts over nine innings in a single game, held by Roger Clemens (twice), Randy Johnson, and Kerry Wood. Scherzer became the first pitcher to strike out 20 batters in a regulation game in the 21st century. He accomplished the feat and earned the win in a matchup with former Nationals teammate Jordan Zimmermann; the final score was 3–2. Scherzer joined Johnson as the only pitchers to have performed both a 20 strikeout game and a no-hitter during their careers. Nine of the strikeouts ended on three-pitch at-bats. Of 119 total pitches discharged, 96 were for strikes; Scherzer did not deliver more than 16 in any inning. It was the first time in history that in any game of 125 or fewer pitches delivered, 96 or more were strikes. It was the third occasion that Tiger manager Brad Ausmus was on the losing side of a 20-strikeout game; the first two were as a player. It was also Scherzer's first career victory versus Detroit, positing him as the 17th hurler to earn a win against all 30 MLB teams.\n",
    "On July 8, 2016, Scherzer was named to the National League squad at the All-Star Game in San Diego as a roster replacement for teammate Stephen Strasburg, who was recently activated from the DL. Scherzer performed in relief in the sixth inning, allowing no baserunners\n"

However, in early January 2017, he withdrew from the tournament after suffering a stress fracture in the knuckle of his right ring finger. Due to the stress fracture, which delayed his start to spring training, Scherzer was unavailable to start Opening Day for the Nationals in 2017. Nonetheless, he avoided spending any time on the disabled list to start the season. On May 14, 2017, he pitched his first career immaculate inning, striking out César Hernández, Odubel Herrera, and Aaron Altherr on nine pitches in the fourth inning versus Philadelphia. It was the 84th immaculate inning in the major leagues, and second in Nationals' history, following Zimmermann's versus the Florida Marlins in 2011. In a 2–1 win versus the Dodgers on June 6, Scherzer struck out 14. He obtained the first 10 outs of the game via strikeout despite his throwing error on a pickoff attempt, two walks allowed, and a passed ball by Matt Wieters.\n",
    "On June 11, Scherzer became the third-fastest pitcher to reach 2,000 strikeouts (after Nolan Ryan and Clayton Kershaw) by striking out Nomar Mazara of the Texas Rangers. Scherzer also reached the 2,000 plateau in the third-fewest innings (1,784), behind Pedro Martínez (1,711+1⁄3) and Randy Johnson (1,733+1⁄3).

In his first 98 starts with the Nationals from 2015 to 2017, Scherzer accumulated the most innings, strikeouts, and pitching WAR. He began a game with at least five hitless innings 11 times, including successfully concluding two no-hitters. He made his third Opening Day start for Washington and struck out seven consecutive Cincinnati Reds batters on the way to a 2–0 win. He set a club Opening Day record with ten batters struck out overall. While playing Atlanta on April 9, he stole his first career base in the seventh inning, versus pitcher Peter Moylan and catcher Kurt Suzuki. On the mound, Scherzer gained a complete-game shutout, the fifth of his career. He struck out 10 and allowed two hits and no walks. He earned the NL Pitcher of the Month Award in April while leading the league in strikeouts (57) and wins (4), and ranking fourth in each of ERA (1.62), WHIP (0.82) and opposing batting average (.165).\n",

He made his following start versus the Arizona Diamondbacks, where he struck out 11 batters and hit an RBI double for the go-ahead run in the fourth inning that furnished a 3–1 Nationals victory. In a May 19 start versus the Dodgers, Scherzer struck out 13, including dispatching his 100th of the season in 63 innings.

He was named the NL Pitcher of the Month for May—his second consecutive monthly award—after going 4–0 with a 2.21 ERA and a league-leading 63 strikeouts. Entering as a pinch hitter in the 14th inning on June 2 versus the Braves, Scherzer singled for his first career pinch-hit and scored the go-ahead run on a triple by Wilmer Difo in a 5–3 victory. In the June 5 contest versus the Tampa Bay Rays, Scherzer settled his second career immaculate inning, striking out Johnny Field, Christian Arroyo and Daniel Robertson in the sixth inning. He joined Lefty Grove, Randy Johnson, Nolan Ryan, and Sandy Koufax as the only (at the time) MLB pitchers to have recorded multiple immaculate innings in a career\n"

He became the third-fastest to achieve the feat based on innings pitched (2155+1⁄3), trailing Johnson and Martínez.\n",

Nevertheless, he made his scheduled start the next day against the Philadelphia Phillies. With discoloration near his right eye, he threw 117 pitches and struck out 10 Phillies hitters over seven scoreless innings as the Nationals won 2–0. In a start on June 30, he faced his former team, the Detroit Tigers.

    "With a low three-quarters delivery (nearly sidearm), and with an overarm starting stretch when nobody is on base, Scherzer throws five pitches: a four-seam fastball with good movement averaging 92–96 mph (topping out at 99 mph), a slider at 85–86 mph, a changeup at 84–85 mph, a cutter at 88–89 mph, and a curveball at 78–79 mph. He primarily uses a fastball-slider combination against right-handed hitters and a fastball-changeup-cutter combination against left-handed hitters. Occasionally he also throws a curveball for the first strike in an at-bat.\n",
    "Scherzer has been nicknamed \"Mad Max\" due in part to a perceived higher-than-normal intensity during gameplay, and unusual and extensive preparation techniques. He also prepares intently on other aspects of the game, including hitting and baserunning. According to Nationals manager Dave Martinez, Scherzer differentiated himself from other major league pitchers because of his focus on hitting in addition to the work on his pitching.\n"

    "Scherzer has heterochromia iridum; his right eye is blue and his left eye is brown. On June 12, 2011, the Detroit Tigers distributed a bobblehead doll depicting Scherzer with the condition correctly portrayed. In the spring of 2017, the Nationals unveiled a \"delightfully creepy\" crop of Scherzer's eyes, correctly portrayed as blue and brown, with backward and forward Ks edited into the pupils.\n",
    "Scherzer met his future wife, Erica May, at the University of Missouri, where they both were pitchers. May pitched for the Mizzou softball team. After more than eight years of dating, the couple married in November 2013. They have three daughters and a son. They welcomed their first daughter on November 29, 2017. On July 4, 2019, his second daughter was born. Their third child, a boy, was born on May 2, 2021; Scherzer pitched a complete game before leaving for the hospital that afternoon. Their fourth child, a girl, was born on January 30, 2023. The Scherzers owned four rescue dogs and two cats as of 2017. The family resided in McLean, a Northern Virginia suburb of Washington, D.C., but they listed the home for sale in 2020. That same year, they purchased a home in Jupiter, Florida.\n",

In 2013, they partnered with the Detroit Tigers Foundation on a program called Scherzer's Superstars, in which groups from the Metropolitan Detroit chapter of Big Brothers Big Sisters of America were invited to Comerica Park every Tuesday home game to meet Scherzer and some of his Detroit teammates and go down to the field for batting practice. In 2015, after her husband signed with the Washington Nationals and inspired by the actions of his future teammate Sean Doolittle and Doolittle's future wife, Eireann Dolan, Erica May-Scherzer partnered with organizers of the Nationals' annual \"Night Out\" event for LGBT fans and led an effort by Nationals' spouses to promote the event.\n",
    "May-Scherzer is an ambassador for the Polaris Project, which aims to stop human trafficking; Scherzer started a fundraiser during the Nationals' 2016 season called Strike Out Modern Slavery in which the couple matched donations to Polaris for every strikeout Scherzer threw that season. Both Max and Erica are involved with the Humane Rescue Alliance, announcing after Hurricane Harvey in August 2017 that they would pay all pet adoption fees from the Washington, D.C.-based group's shelters for four days. When he was pitching for the Mets, the Scherzers agreed to cover the adoption fee at St. Hubert's Animal Welfare Center in Madison, New Jersey for any dog over 30 pounds adopted from June 6 to 12, 2022\n"
