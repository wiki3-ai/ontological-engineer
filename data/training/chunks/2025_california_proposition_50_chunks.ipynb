    "California Proposition 50, officially known as the Election Rigging Response Act, is an amendment to the constitution of the U.S. state of California, which was passed by voters in a special election ballot on November 4, 2025. At the urging of California governor Gavin Newsom, the proposition was put on the ballot by the Democratic-controlled California State Legislature. Approved by 64.4% of voters, the proposition redrew the state's congressional districts, replacing the ones drawn by the bipartisan California Citizens Redistricting Commission during the earlier 2020 redistricting cycle. The new districts will be used for the 2026 United States House of Representatives elections through the 2030 elections. Following the 2030 census, congressional redistricting authority will return to the independent commission under the normal decennial process.\n",
    "The map defined in Proposition 50 is a Democratic gerrymander claimed to intend to offset the gerrymander by Texas Republicans, both of which are part of the broader 2025–2026 United States redistricting effort. It redraws several congressional districts to incorporate larger shares of urban and suburban Democratic voters, increasing Democratic registration advantages in competitive districts and converting several Republican-leaning seats into Democratic-leaning ones. Republicans have responded to Proposition 50 with legislation, their own propositions, and litigation.\n"

    "In June 2025, Republican lawmakers in Texas first proposed gerrymandering the state's congressional district lines to favor Republicans. In July, Greg Abbott, the Governor of Texas, called a special session of the Texas Legislature to discuss redistricting. Texas Democrats in the state House of Representatives fled the state in an effort to break quorum and stall the redistricting effort.\n",
    "Gavin Newsom, the Governor of California, first proposed that California could gerrymander its own congressional district maps to favor Democrats in an effort to offset potential gains from Texas's gerrymandering. The California Citizens Redistricting Commission is an independent bipartisan body that currently handles redistricting in the state. The commission was first established in 2008 by Proposition 11 with a mandate for drawing districts for the State Legislature and the Board of Equalization.\n",
    "With the passage of Proposition 20, the commission's power was expanded in 2010 to also draw congressional districts. Newsom proposed that a special election be called to temporarily pause the commission and return redistricting power to the California Legislature until the end of the decade\n"

    "The new map was drawn by Democratic redistricting expert Paul Mitchell, and formally submitted to the legislature by the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. Proponents of the maps argued that the map was more compact than the previous map, with fewer city and county splits, and with the majority of districts changed by less than 10%, although certain cities, such as Lodi, will be newly split. Non-partisan observers saw it as a gerrymandering; for example, analyst Nathaniel Rakich described the maps as an \"aggressive Democratic gerrymander\" that will more than double the bias in the current map as a result of simultaneously cracking Republican districts and unpacking extremely Democratic districts through absorbing more-Republican areas.\n",

Hours later, the California State Senate surpassed the 27 votes needed for a supermajority by approving the bill on a 30 to 8 vote. Governor Newsom signed it into law later in the day.

An official within the office of Governor Newsom told the Fresno ABC affiliate KFSN-TV that they did not respond because they were not properly served.

A petition for a temporary injunction was denied, and the case was dismissed on October 23 by Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk for inability to demonstrate a cognizable injury. A second lawsuit filed by Jackson, which only differed from the prior suit with the addition of California U.S. Representative Darrell Issa (R) as a co-plaintiff, was dismissed by Kacsmaryk on October 31 on the same grounds.\n",
