    "Monster: The Ed Gein Story is the third season of the American biographical crime drama anthology television series Monster, created by Ryan Murphy and Ian Brennan for Netflix. The season focuses on convicted murderer, graverobber, and suspected serial killer Ed Gein, portrayed by Charlie Hunnam. The cast also includes Suzanna Son, Vicky Krieps, Laurie Metcalf, and Tom Hollander. The season incorporates meta commentary on the cultural obsession with true crime, exploring Gein's influence on Hollywood and pop culture. \n",
    "It is the third installment in the Monster anthology series, following Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story (2022) and Monsters: The Lyle and Erik Menendez Story (2024). A season based on Ed Gein was announced to be in development on September 14, 2024. It is the first season not helmed by Murphy, with Brennan serving as the sole creator and writer. \n",
    "Upon its premiere on October 3, 2025, the season received negative reviews and was deemed inferior to its predecessors, with critics panning its meta commentary, subplots, runtime, excessive graphic violence, and factual inaccuracies. While critical responses to Hunnam's performance were divided, he ultimately received nominations for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Miniseries or Television Film and the Critics' Choice Television Award for Best Actor in a Movie/Miniseries. \n",
    "A fourth season, based on parricide suspect Lizzie Borden, is currently in production.\n"

It earned 2.8 million views (21.2 million hours viewed) in its fourth week and stayed on Netflix's Top 10 most-watched English-language shows globally for five weeks, shorter than the seven-week runs of both The Lyle and Erik Menendez Story and The Jeffrey Dahmer Story.\n"

    "In her review for Variety, Aramide Tinubu commends the season for its strong production values, highlighting the \"absolutely outstanding performances\" of the lead actors and the \"classic noir film style\" portrayal of 1950s Wisconsin. However, she criticizes the series for its campy tone, excessive graphic violence, and overabundance of subplots, which contribute to a lack of cohesive tone and resolution. Tinubu argues that the show prioritizes Ed Gein's pop culture image over a deeper exploration of his abusive mother–son relationship with Augusta, a theme introduced in the first episode but largely abandoned thereafter. She concludes that this focus \"makes Ed Gein mythical again, and in turn strips away the texture and grit that was desperately needed to make the series work.\"\n",
    "The Hollywood Reporter's Daniel Fienberg criticized the season as a \"tired, overstuffed mess\" that squanders Charlie Hunnam's and Laurie Metcalf's performances, while failing to meaningfully engage with the series' meta themes on true crime's cultural legacy. Fienberg questioned the show's decision to depict explicit imagery, noting that it caters to audience demand for \"monstrosities\" while at the same time mocking their consumption of it\n"
