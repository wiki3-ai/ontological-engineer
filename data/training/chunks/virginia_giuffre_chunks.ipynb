    "Virginia Louise Giuffre (, JOO-fray; née Roberts; August 9, 1983 – April 25, 2025) was an American and Australian advocate for survivors of sex trafficking and one of the most prominent accusers of the child sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. In 2015, Giuffre founded Victims Refuse Silence, a U.S. non-profit organization dedicated to supporting survivors. The organization was relaunched as Speak Out, Act, Reclaim (SOAR) in November 2021. She provided detailed accounts to numerous American and British reporters about being trafficked by Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell.\n",
    "Giuffre pursued criminal and civil actions against Epstein and Maxwell while appealing directly to the public for justice and awareness. She sued Maxwell for defamation in 2015; the case was settled in Giuffre's favor in 2017 for an undisclosed sum. On July 2, 2019, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit ordered the unsealing of documents from Giuffre's civil suit against Maxwell. The first batch of documents was released on August 9, 2019, further implicating Epstein, Maxwell, and their associates. The following day, Epstein was found dead in his Manhattan prison cell.\n",
    "In a December 2019 BBC Panorama interview, Giuffre described being trafficked by Epstein to the United Kingdom's then-Prince Andrew, which shifted public opinion against the former prince. She later sued Andrew in a New York civil court\n"

    "Virginia Louise Roberts was born in Sacramento, California, on August 9, 1983, to Lynn Trude Cabell and Sky William Roberts. She had an elder half-brother, Daniel Scott Wilson, from her mother's previous marriage, and a younger brother, Sky Rocket Roberts. The family relocated to Loxahatchee, in Palm Beach County, Florida, when she was four years old. It was reported that she had come from a \"troubled home\" and, from the age of seven, was molested by a close family friend. In her memoir, Giuffre stated that she was abused by her father from as early as the age of seven and that he might have received payments from Jeffrey Epstein at some point, allegations which he denied. \"I was just so mentally scarred already at such a young age, and I ran away from that\", she said on Panorama in 2019. Giuffre told the Miami Herald that she went from being in \"an abusive situation, to being a runaway, to living in foster homes\". She lived on the streets at age 14, where she says she found only \"hunger and pain and [more] abuse\". Later she was abused by a sex trafficker, Ron Eppinger, in Miami. Giuffre lived with Eppinger for approximately six months. Eppinger reportedly ran a front business for international sex trafficking known as the modeling agency \"Perfect 10\"\n"

    "In mid-2000, Giuffre met Ghislaine Maxwell when working as a spa attendant at Donald Trump's private Mar-a-Lago club while reading a book about massage therapy. Maxwell, a British socialite and daughter of media tycoon Robert Maxwell, approached Giuffre, noted the book that she was reading, inquired about her interest in massage, and offered her a potential job working for Epstein as a traveling masseuse with the assurance that no experience was necessary. When Giuffre arrived at Epstein's Palm Beach home, she says he was lying down, naked, and Maxwell told her how to massage him. \"They seemed like nice people so I trusted them, and I told them I'd had a really hard time in my life up until then—I'd been a runaway, I'd been sexually abused, physically abused. ... That was the worst thing I could have told them because now they knew how vulnerable I was\", Giuffre stated. Giuffre stated that after Maxwell introduced her to Jeffrey Epstein, the two quickly began grooming her to provide sexual services, under the guise that she was to be trained as a professional massage therapist.\n",
    "Between 2000 and 2002, Giuffre was closely associated with Epstein and Maxwell, traveling between Epstein's residences in Palm Beach and Manhattan (at the Herbert N. Straus House), with additional trips to Epstein's Zorro Ranch in New Mexico and private island Little Saint James\n"

    ". In the Miami Herald's investigative journalism series \"Perversion of Justice\", Giuffre describes her experiences of being trafficked by Epstein to provide massages and sexual services for him and a number of his business associates, over a two-and-a-half-year period. In her interview with the BBC, Giuffre said she was \"passed around like a platter of fruit\" to Epstein's powerful associates, and taken around the world on private jets.\n",
    "Of the instance in March 2001 that Giuffre was allegedly trafficked to Prince Andrew, she stated in an interview that it was a \"wicked\" and \"really scary time\" in her life, and that she \"couldn't comprehend how in the highest level of the government powerful people were allowing this to happen. Not just allowing but participating in it\". After visiting a nightclub, Giuffre says Maxwell told her that she \"had to do for Andrew what I do for Jeffrey\". In court documents from a civil suit that were released from seal in 2019, Giuffre named several others that she claims Epstein and Maxwell instructed her to have sex with, including hedge fund manager Glenn Dubin, attorney Alan Dershowitz, politician Bill Richardson, MIT scientist Marvin Minsky, lawyer George J. Mitchell, and MC2 modeling agent Jean-Luc Brunel. The men denied Giuffre's allegations.\n",
    "In September 2002, at the age of 19, Giuffre flew to Thailand and attended the International Training Massage School in Chiang Mai\n"

The girl described being recruited by a female classmate from her high school to give Epstein a massage at his mansion in exchange for money, wherein he subsequently molested her. By October 2005, the police had a growing list of girls with similar claims of sexual abuse, statements from Epstein's butlers corroborating their claims, and a search warrant for his Palm Beach property.\n",

One of the girls was called by Epstein's assistant while being questioned by police.\n",

    "In 2006, a year before Giuffre was first contacted by authorities, the Palm Beach Police Department had a growing body of evidence against Epstein, and signed a probable cause affidavit charging him with multiple counts of unlawful sex acts with a minor. Epstein hired a team of powerful lawyers, including Alan Dershowitz, Jack Goldberger, Ken Starr, and Jay Lefkowitz, to serve in his defense. As the case progressed, Police Chief Michael Reiter became alarmed at the handling of the case by state prosecutors and then state attorney, Barry Krischer. On May 1, 2006, Reiter asked Krischer to remove himself from the case; when Krischer declined, Police Chief Reiter turned his evidence over to the FBI for federal prosecution. While Reiter was initially hopeful that the FBI would thoroughly investigate and move the matter to a conclusion, in 2007, then South Florida U.S. Attorney Alexander Acosta decided not to prosecute Epstein in federal court and referred the matter back to the local jurisdiction.\n",
    "Lead police detective Joseph Recarey said that the state prosecutors were at first eager to pursue criminal action against Epstein, but that \"everything took a turn\" when lawyer Alan Dershowitz got involved. Krischer then decided to take the unusual action of turning Epstein's case over to a grand jury, and then presented testimony from only one girl. Epstein's legal team aggressively sought concessions and prolonged the process when negotiating a plea deal with Acosta\n"

Epstein sued Bradley Edwards for civil racketeering but later dropped his suit; Edwards countersued for malicious prosecution, with the result that Epstein issued a public apology to the lawyer and settled the case for an undisclosed sum in December 2018. Edwards, who represents several Epstein accusers in addition to Giuffre, reportedly settled in aid of his clients, whose greatest wish was to pursue their larger objective of having their allegations heard in a federal court in order to overturn the non-prosecution agreement. Edwards stated that \"They're willing to talk. They want to share their stories. This was part of their healing.\"\n",

Vanity Fair stated that Giuffre's story was first publicized in March 2011 by the Mail on Sunday; the coverage included the photo showing Prince Andrew with his arm around her at Maxwell's house in Belgravia, London. FBI agents again made contact with Giuffre, this time at the US consulate in Sydney in 2011, soon after she went public with allegations against Epstein.\n",
    "In December 2014, Giuffre set up the framework for her organization Victims Refuse Silence. It was registered as a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization in 2015. The objective of Victims Refuse Silence is to \"help survivors surmount the shame, silence, and intimidation typically experienced by victims of sexual abuse, and to help others to escape becoming victims of sex trafficking\". For her organization, Giuffre used imagery of a blue Morpho butterfly to symbolize the transformation and empowerment that occurs when a victim becomes a survivor. Blue is the international color of human trafficking awareness. The United States has designated January as Human Trafficking Awareness Month with January 11 listed as National Wear Blue Day. Giuffre's charity was relaunched in November 2021 under the name Speak Out, Act, Reclaim (SOAR).\n"

She stated that Epstein and Maxwell took her to Tramp nightclub in London, where she met and danced with Andrew and that later that night, while en route to Maxwell's Belgravia residence, Maxwell instructed Giuffre to \"do for (Prince Andrew) what you do for Epstein\".

Maxwell, while serving her prison sentence, stated to several interviewers that she believed the photograph was fake. Following the allegations, The Mail on Sunday, which first published the photograph in 2011, was contacted by the photographer Michael Thomas, who took 39 copies of it, front and back. The back of the photo has a time stamp showing it was developed on March 13, 2001 – three days after Andrew allegedly engaged in sexual activity with Giuffre – and it was printed at a one-hour photo lab at Walgreens in Florida near Giuffre's former home.\n",

    "\n",
    "On August 9, 2021, Giuffre filed a civil lawsuit in New York against Prince Andrew alleging that she was forced to have several sexual encounters with him in the early 2000s after being trafficked by Epstein when she was 16 and 17 years old. Andrew denied Giuffre's claims. On January 12, 2022, Judge Lewis A. Kaplan rejected Andrew's attempts to dismiss the case, allowing the sexual abuse lawsuit to proceed.\n",
    "On February 15, 2022, the parties reached an out-of-court settlement, which included the prince making a substantial donation to Giuffre's charity. As part of the settlement, Prince Andrew acknowledged that it is \"known that Jeffrey Epstein trafficked countless young girls over many years\" and that he \"regrets his association with Epstein, and commends the bravery of Ms. Giuffre and other survivors in standing up for themselves and others\". Andrew pledged to \"demonstrate his regret for his association with Epstein by supporting the fight against the evils of sex trafficking, and by supporting its victims\".\n",
    "The settlement was estimated to be as high as £12 million, part of which went to SOAR (Speak Out, Act, Reclaim), the advocacy charity for survivors of sex trafficking that Giuffre had founded. In August 2022, The Sun newspaper reported the settlement figure to be around £3 million, much lower than the values initially reported.\n"

Dershowitz represented Epstein in his 2008 criminal conviction and helped to negotiate the controversial non-prosecution agreement on his behalf.\n",
    "The claims first appeared in a December 30, 2014, Florida court filing by lawyers Bradley J. Edwards and Paul G. Cassell which alleged that Dershowitz was one of several prominent figures, including Prince Andrew, to have participated in sexual activities with a minor later identified as Giuffre.  The affidavit from Giuffre was meant for inclusion as part of the 2008 lawsuit (Jane Doe v. USA) accusing the Justice Department of violating the Crime Victims Rights Act during Epstein's first criminal case.  Dershowitz vehemently denied the allegations in Giuffre's statement and sought disbarment of Edwards and Cassell, the lawyers filing the suit.  Edwards and Cassell sued Dershowitz for defamation in 2015; he countersued.  The two parties settled in 2016 for an undisclosed financial sum.\n",
    "Following denials by Dershowitz, Giuffre stated, \"I'm not going to be bullied back into silence.\"\n",

    "Jeffrey Epstein was arrested on July 6, 2019, at Teterboro Airport in New Jersey and charged with sex trafficking and sex trafficking conspiracy by prosecutors with the Public Corruption Unit of the Southern District of New York. In the indictment, Epstein was accused of soliciting massages from underage girls where the activities became increasingly sexual and then of enlisting the girls to recruit other underage victims for pay. U.S. Attorney Geoffrey Berman of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York appealed for other victims of Epstein to come forward. The federal indictment also listed the key role of Epstein's paid \"employees and associates\" responsible for scheduling victims.\n",
    "One month after his arrest, Epstein was found dead on August 10, 2019, after reportedly hanging himself in his Manhattan prison cell.\n",
    "On August 29, 2019, in the wake of Epstein's death 19 days prior, the case against Epstein was closed after District Judge Richard Berman dismissed all sex trafficking charges. Judge Berman expressed support for Epstein's accusers, stating that he invited them to speak publicly at a hearing on August 27, 2019, out of \"respect\" for \"the difficult decisions victims made to come forward\". Giuffre was among the 16 women who spoke publicly at the hearing, which included Anouska De Georgiou, Sarah Ransome, Jennifer Araoz, Chauntae Davies, Courtney Wild, Theresa J. Helm, and Marijke Chartouni\n"

Giuffre's Australia-based attorney Karrie Louden said she believed that Giuffre's death was not \"suspicious in any way\" and that \"The Coroner will determine in due course the cause of death and that will be established based on the evidence.\" At the time, the BBC noted that \"there is still much that is not known about Ms Giuffre's last days or her personal circumstances.\"\n"
