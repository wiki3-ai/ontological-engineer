    "The 2025 FIA Formula One World Championship was a motor racing championship for Formula One cars and the 76th running of the Formula One World Championship. It was recognised by the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA), the governing body of international motorsport, as the highest class of competition for open-wheel racing cars. The championship was contested over twenty-four Grands Prix held around the world. It began in March and ended in December.\n",
    "Drivers and teams competed for the titles of World Drivers' Champion and World Constructors' Champion, respectively. The season saw Lando Norris climb to the summit of the sport as he overcame early season struggles and mistakes and a notable mechanical retirement at the Dutch Grand Prix to win his first drivers' title in his seventh season in the sport thus ending the four year reign of Max Verstappen as champion.  The season was largely dominated by McLaren drivers Norris and Oscar Piastri, and reigning Drivers' Champion Max Verstappen, driving for Red Bull Racing-Honda RBPT. All three were in the running for the World Drivers' Championship in the final race in Abu Dhabi with Norris in the pre-finale championship lead. Norris maintained his pre-Abu Dhabi points lead at the finish to claim his maiden World Drivers' Championship by just two points ahead of defending champion Verstappen, who showed a strong late-season form, and 13 points ahead of his teammate Piastri, who had led the championship for 15 rounds\n"

    ". Norris became the eleventh different British driver and 35th driver overall to claim the World Drivers' Championship, and the eighth championship-winning McLaren driver following Lewis Hamilton in 2008. At the Singapore Grand Prix, McLaren secured their tenth World Constructors' Championship title, moving them to second on all-time most World Constructors' Championship titles. It was also their first win of consecutive constructors' titles since 1991, and first double championship winning season since 1998.\n",
    "The 2025 season was the last year to utilise the power unit configuration introduced in 2014. A revised configuration without the Motor Generator Unit-Heat (MGU-H), but with a higher power output from the Motor Generator Unit-Kinetic (MGU-K), will be introduced for 2026. 2025 also marked the final year of the ground-effect generation of cars introduced in 2022, and the last year of the drag reduction system (DRS) introduced as an overtaking aid in 2011, as cars with active aerodynamics and moveable wings will be introduced in 2026.\n",
    "2025 marked the last time the Sauber name appeared in Formula One, with the constructor taking on the Audi name in 2026. It was also Renault's final season as an active power unit supplier for Alpine, with the manufacturer discontinuing engine production following the season's conclusion.\n"

    "Drivers' comments are due to be subject to more stringent regulation and stricter punishment. The issue had first come to light when Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile president Mohammed Ben Sulayem said in an interview that he wanted to see less bad language in Formula One. This was closely followed by Max Verstappen and Charles Leclerc, both being investigated and punished for swearing in Formula One interviews. The penalties for \"driver misconduct\" covers \"language, [...], gesture[s] and/or sign[s] that is offensive, insulting, coarse, rude or abusive and might reasonably be expected or be perceived to be coarse or rude or to cause offense, humiliation or to be inappropriate\", as well as assault and \"incitement to do any of the above\". A first offence would incur a €40,000 fine; a second, an €80,000 fine and one-month suspension; and a third, a €120,000 fine, one-month suspension, and point deduction. The same penalty scale will apply to any \"moral injury or loss\" to the \"FIA, its bodies, its members or its executive officers\" or its values. The making of \"political, religious and personal statements or comments\" which contravenes the FIA's neutrality will also be subject to the same penalties, with the added caveat that drivers will be required to make a full apology and retract their statement\n"

Previously, drivers could navigate back to the garage even if their cars were damaged and posed a safety risk to others on track. The updated rule now allows the race director to instruct teams to retire a car if it has substantial structural damage or a critical failure that could endanger others or hinder competition. In such cases, the driver must pull over at the nearest safe location rather than continue towards the pit lane.\n"

As the Grand Prix is run over 57 laps, each driver going full race distance inevitably had to change tyres at least twice. Unlike the 2023 race, laps run under the safety car or virtual safety car counted towards the limit.\n"

    "McLaren's Lando Norris took pole position for the Australian Grand Prix, which was held under changing, intermediate conditions. Isack Hadjar did not start the race, crashing his Racing Bulls during the formation lap. Norris led a majority of the race, but he briefly lost the lead when he and teammate Oscar Piastri lost control in intermediate conditions. Because of this, Piastri was beached for a short time before he freed himself, dropping to thirteenth and later recovering to ninth. Max Verstappen, in the Red Bull, was trailing Norris as the race reached its closing stages. Norris kept Verstappen behind to win the Grand Prix, bringing McLaren its first win in Australia since 2012. In doing so, Norris also broke Verstappen's reign of consecutive days leading the Drivers' Championship, which the Red Bull driver had held since the 2022 Spanish Grand Prix. Kimi Antonelli recovered twelve places from his sixteenth-place start to finish in fourth. Five further retirements were observed: Jack Doohan for Alpine, Carlos Sainz Jr. for Williams, Fernando Alonso for Aston Martin, Gabriel Bortoleto for Sauber, and Verstappen's teammate, Liam Lawson.\n",
    "Lewis Hamilton took sprint pole position for the Chinese Grand Prix, which he converted into Ferrari's first sprint victory ahead of Piastri and Verstappen. Norris qualified in sixth for the sprint and finished in eighth. Piastri then took pole for the main race, achieving his maiden career pole position\n"

    "Oscar Piastri returned to pole position at the Spanish Grand Prix, which he converted into a victory ahead of his teammate Lando Norris and Ferrari's Charles Leclerc. Following a retirement of Kimi Antonelli's Mercedes – caused by mechanical failure – a safety car was brought out on lap 53. Shortly after the race resumed on lap 60, Max Verstappen collided with Antonelli's teammate George Russell, after the former was told to give the position back to the Mercedes driver after he overtook Russell off track. Verstappen then received a ten-second time penalty which resulted in him dropping to tenth. Nico Hülkenberg was one of many beneficiaries, finishing in fifth place and earning Sauber's highest finish since the 2022 Emilia Romagna Grand Prix. Meanwhile, Fernando Alonso, who finished in ninth place, scored his first points of the season eight races in, equalling 2015 for his worst start to a season.\n",
    "Russell became the first non-McLaren and non-Red Bull driver of the season to take pole position, doing so at the Canadian Grand Prix. Piastri started third with teammate Norris starting seventh after making a mistake in his flying lap. In a race ultimately defined by strategy calls, Russell won out in the end following a late safety car period, marking Mercedes's first win of the season – finishing ahead of Verstappen and Antonelli, the latter recording his maiden career podium in third to become the third-youngest podium finisher in Formula One history\n"

The race ended under the safety car after Norris rammed Piastri's diffuser while attempting an overtake on the pit straight, forcing the former into the wall and inflicting terminal damage to his MCL39 – his and the McLaren team's first retirement since the 2024 Austrian Grand Prix. He would still be classified in 18th following two other retirements: the Williams of Alex Albon and Lawson.\n",
    "Norris was back on pole position at the Austrian Grand Prix. Following an aborted start due to issues with Carlos Sainz Jr.'s brakes, the McLarens broke out ahead while Antonelli locked up and hit Verstappen, forcing both to retire and the safety car to be deployed; Verstappen's Red Bull teammate did not fare any better, with Tsunoda finishing sixteenth – the last of the finishing cars – after receiving a time penalty. Due to this, Red Bull failed to score any points of any kind, the first since the 2022 Bahrain Grand Prix. After leading a majority of the race, Norris converted pole position into his third win of the season ahead of teammate and championship leader Piastri, and Leclerc. Gabriel Bortoleto scored his first points in the championship while Hülkenberg finished ninth, marking the first double points finish for Sauber since the 2023 Qatar Grand Prix.\n"

    "Verstappen found himself on pole position for the British Grand Prix after the cars he was battling with – the McLarens and Ferraris – made mistakes during their flying laps. The race was began in wet conditions on intermediate tyres, but the Mercedes of Russell, Leclerc, Hadjar, Bortoleto, and Bearman opted to start from the pit lane after swapping to slick tyres following the formation lap. The slicks, however were ineffective on the track, which remained damp. On the first few laps, green flag running was limited; Bearman's teammate Esteban Ocon squeezed himself between Tsunoda and Lawson, with the latter being the first to retire after suffering damage to his rear-left suspension. Soon afterward, Bortoleto then found himself in the wall with damage to his rear wing, and during a sustained period of heavy rain, Hadjar himself had a heavy hit into Copse corner after ramming Antonelli's diffuser and spinning off the track, facilitating a safety car period. Race leader Oscar Piastri braked erratically during this safety car period and was awarded a ten-second time penalty. As the race entered its closing stages, the track began to dry, and drivers returned to slick tyres. With Piastri serving his penalty, Norris took the race lead; he went on to become the thirteenth British driver to win their home race\n"

    "Norris, Verstappen and Piastri all entered the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix with a chance to win the Drivers' Championship. Verstappen qualified on pole position, ahead of Norris in second and Piastri in third. Piastri overtook Norris for second halfway through the first lap. Norris faced pressure from behind by Charles Leclerc, and was later investigated for overtaking Red Bull's Yuki Tsunoda off the track. Tsunoda was penalised for the incident, and the top three held onto their positions by the end of the race. Verstappen won the race from pole position, with Piastri in second and Norris in third. Norris clinched his first World Championship, securing McLaren's first Drivers' Championship since 2008.\n"
