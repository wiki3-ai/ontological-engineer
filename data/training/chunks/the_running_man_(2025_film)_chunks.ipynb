    "In the near future, the United States is ruled by an authoritarian media network, referred simply as the Network. Most viewers live in poverty with little access to healthcare, and the Network placates the masses with trashy, violent game shows and reality television. The most popular program is The Running Man, where \"runners\" can win $1 billion by surviving 30 days, while the Network's five hunters, led by the mysterious Evan McCone, as well as ordinary citizens try to find and kill them. Given $1,000 and a 12-hour head start, runners are required to film themselves every day, or else forfeit their earnings but still be hunted.\n",
    "Ben Richards, a blue-collar worker in the slums of Co-Op City, is unable to afford flu medicine for his infant daughter, Cathy, after being blacklisted for union activism. Ben tries out for the Network, intending to join a less dangerous show, but is unexpectedly chosen for The Running Man along with Tim Jansky and Jenni Laughlin. Executive producer Dan Killian convinces Ben to join by offering him a safe house for his family and an advance for Cathy's medication.\n",
    "As the hunt begins, Ben travels to New York City. Checking into a hotel in disguise, Ben watches the live feed of hunters killing Tim. He flees to Boston.\n",
    "In Boston, the hunters and soldiers track Ben to a hostel and shoot at him, leading to an explosion that kills eight soldiers\n"

Ben sends a video denouncing their action, but the broadcast content is replaced with a foul-mouthed deepfake of Ben, angering the public including Bradley's mother, who kicks him out of the house.\n",
    "Bradley sends Ben to Derry, Maine, to meet Elton Parrakis, a fellow activist who prepares to lead Ben to a bunker for the remainder of his run. Ben stops Elton's mother from alerting the authorities, but Elton does so anyway, dispatching them with booby traps to avenge his father. Ben and Elton flee in a buggy, but McCone kills Elton. Ben crashes the buggy into another Hunter on a bridge and escapes into the river below. \n",
    "Jenni is killed, leaving Ben as the sole remaining contestant, while his survival has earned the support of the poor and working class. \n",
    "Traveling north, Ben discovers that a land development has paved over the bunker. Escaping surveillance drones, he commandeers a passing car and takes the wealthy driver, Amelia Williams, hostage. Amelia realizes the truth about the Network's propaganda after seeing televised deepfakes of herself and agrees to help Ben. Reaching an airfield, they take off in a jet to Canada, guarded by McCone. Killian calls to offer Ben his own show as the Network's newest hunter if he kills McCone and the remaining hunters, broadcasting footage of them murdering Sheila and Cathy to drum up support for Ben\n"

Killing McCone, Ben sends Amelia to safety with a parachute and Elton's revolutionary pamphlets. Killian gives Ben the chance to accept his new show on live TV, but Ben instead pleads for viewers to hunt down Killian and his fellow executives. The Network redirects the jet to their headquarters, airing a deepfake of Ben threatening to crash into the building, and the plane is shot down.\n",

Ben, who survived due to the plane's auto-eject function, has become the face of the revolution and reunites with his family, whose deaths were faked by Killian. As the next season of The Running Man begins, host Bobby Thompson senses the audience's hostility and quits, leaving Killian to host the show.

Additional cast members were announced in the following months. Domain Entertainment co-financed the film with Paramount.\n",

Filming concluded on 28 March 2025. Paul Machliss was the editor, making it his fifth collaboration with Wright. Industrial Light & Magic provided the visual effects.\n"

    "On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 63% of 279 critics' reviews are positive. The website's consensus reads: \"Spiritedly sprinting through grim source material, Edgar Wright's The Running Man doesn't live up to the director's high bar for inventive action extravaganzas but maintains a slick stride.\" Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 56 out of 100, based on 52 critics, indicating \"mixed or average\" reviews. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave it an average grade of \"B+\" on an A+ to F scale, the same as the original film.\n",
    "Chris Klimek called The Running Man a \"bloody hoot\" in a 3.5-out-of-4 review for The Washington Post, with praise for the direction and performances. Matt Zoller Seitz of RogerEbert.com gave it two and a half out of four, writing: \"The relentless pace generates enough of an endorphin rush to power the movie beyond plausibility nitpicking. It also prevents the audience from probing its worldview too closely, up to a point. That's probably for the best.\" Owen Gleiberman of Variety viewed the remake as an improvement on the 1987 Schwarzenegger movie, but he did not find the dystopian themes unique or compelling\n"

Gleiberman wrote that \"because we’ve seen so many garishly downbeat sci-fi movies, dystopia is now the air that our imaginations breathe.\" Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian awarded the film three stars out of five, calling it \"retro-futurist and steampunky, though it is always watchable and buoyant.\" He reserved praise for Wright's confident direction. Stephen King, who disliked the original film, praised the 2025 adaptation, calling it a \"bipartisan thrill ride\".\n"
