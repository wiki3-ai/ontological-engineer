    "Martin is said to be “the most successful and prominent female boxer in the United States” and the person who “legitimized” women’s participation in the sport of boxing. She began her career fighting in “Toughwoman” contests and won three consecutive titles. She then began training with boxing coach, Jim Martin, who became her husband in 1991.\n",
    "Martin started her professional boxing career at the age of 21 with a six-round draw with Angela Buchanan in 1989. She had her first training under the direction of Charlie Sensabaugh of Daniels, West Virginia. Martin won a rematch with Buchanan one month later with a second round knockout. Andrea DeShong then beat Martin in a five-round decision. Martin then had nineteen consecutive wins, including two against Jamie Whitcomb and Suzanne Riccio-Major as well as a rubber match win against Buchanan. On October 15, 1993, Martin defeated Beverly Szymansky. Martin won by knocking out Szymansky in three rounds. Martin fought to a draw against debutante Laura Serrano in Las Vegas.\n",
    "Martin's next fights included a rematch with Szymansky and a fourth fight with Buchanan. In 1993 Martin signed a promotional agreement with International Hall of Fame Promoter Don King that would put her in the international spotlight\n"

    "In March 2010, Christy Martin reconnected with her high school girlfriend Sherry Lusk over social media. Sometime later, Martin told her husband she wanted a divorce. On November 23, 2010, Christy Martin was stabbed several times and shot at least once in her torso and left for dead by her husband, 66-year-old James V. Martin. The attack reportedly occurred after an argument in their Apopka home. \n",
    "She survived the attack. On November 30, 2010, James Martin was arrested and taken to Orlando Regional Medical Center after he stabbed himself. He was booked in Orange County Jail and charged with attempted first-degree murder and aggravated battery with a deadly weapon.\n",
    "In April 2012, James Martin was found guilty of attempted second-degree murder. Two months later, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison, the mandatory minimum sentence. James Martin died on November 26, 2024, while serving his sentence at Graceville Correctional Facility.\n"
