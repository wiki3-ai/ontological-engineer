    "The series follows Morgan Gillory, a single mother of three who works as a cleaner at the Los Angeles Police Department. Morgan has an IQ of 160, classifying her as a high-potential intellectual (HPI). When she unexpectedly solves a complex case using her unorthodox thinking and keen observational skills, she is recruited as a civilian consultant for the LAPD's Major Crimes Division. There, she is partnered with Detective Adam Karadec, a disciplined and methodical investigator whose by-the-book approach often clashes with Morgan's intuitive and unconventional methods. \n",
    "A subplot follows Morgan's use of LAPD resources to investigate the 15-year-old disappearance of Roman, the father of her daughter Ava.\n"

    "Aramide Tinubu of Variety asserted that High Potential is a solid police procedural, praised Kaitlin Olson's performance, noting her ability to bring quirky charm to the role. Tinubu found the show's premise to be engaging, with Morgan's genius-level IQ and eccentricities offering a unique spin on the crime genre. Tinubu stated that while High Potential does not break new ground in the genre, it remains a perfectly adequate and formulaic watch. Tinubu appreciated the supporting cast, especially the chemistry between Olson and her co-stars, and highlighted the intriguing dynamic between Morgan and Detective Karadec. \n",
    "Daniel Fienberg of The Hollywood Reporter said that High Potential is a show with a promising star but a shaky premise, praising Olson for her strong performance as Morgan. Fienberg found the exposition in the pilot, particularly Morgan's unsolicited revelation of her IQ, to be off-putting and distracting, noting it undermines the character's likability\n"
