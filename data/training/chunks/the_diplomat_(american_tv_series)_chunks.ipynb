    "The Diplomat is an American political thriller television series created by Debora Cahn. First airing in 2023, it stars Keri Russell as a veteran U.S. diplomat who is unexpectedly appointed as the ambassador to the United Kingdom amid an emerging international crisis.\n",
    "The series premiered on Netflix on April 20, 2023. In October 2024, the series was renewed for a third season, which premiered on October 16, 2025. In May 2025, the series was renewed for a fourth season.\n",
    "The Diplomat has received critical acclaim for its writing, pacing, and performances, particularly those of Russell and (beginning in season 2) Allison Janney. At the 77th Primetime Emmy Awards in 2025, the series was nominated for Outstanding Drama Series. Russell has been nominated for two Primetime Emmy Awards, two Screen Actors Guild Awards, and two Golden Globe Awards.\n",
    "The show has been praised for its nuanced portrayal of foreign policy and the often invisible work of diplomacy, as well as its character-driven storytelling that blends political intrigue with personal drama.\n"
