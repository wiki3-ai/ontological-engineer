    "Rashmika Mandanna was born on 5 April 1996 to Suman and Madan Mandanna into a Kodava Hindu family in Virajpet, a town in Kodagu district, Karnataka. Her father owns a coffee estate and a function hall in her hometown, and her mother is a homemaker. She has a younger sister, Shiman whom she helped raise and felt like a maternal figure to. As a child, her family struggled financially, and had difficulties finding a home and paying rent; according to Mandanna, her parents could not afford to buy her toys and the experience has continued to taint her relationship with money.\n",
    "Mandanna attended Coorg Public School, a boarding school in Gonikoppal. During this phase of her life, she was often misunderstood due to her struggles with communication, making connecting with her peers difficult. Mandanna credits her mother for being a stabilising influence in her life and labelled her \"my biggest strength\".\n",
    "Mandanna studied for a bachelor's degree in psychology, journalism and English literature at M. S. Ramaiah College of Arts, Science and Commerce in Bangalore. In 2014, Mandanna was awarded The Times of India's Clean & Clear Fresh Face that recognises high-potential individuals; she was subsequently made a brand ambassador for Clean & Clear as part of the winning reward\n"

    "After noticing her win a pageant in 2015, Rishab Shetty offered Mandanna her debut in his Kannada romantic comedy Kirik Party (2016) opposite Rakshit Shetty. She was introduced as Saanvi, a college student with ambitions of becoming an engineer; Mandanna said she deeply related to the character's studious nature and the experience of often being overlooked at school. In a positive review for The Times of India, Sunayana Suresh wrote that Mandanna \"is easily that pin-up girl in college and she breathes her path\". Kirik Party emerged as the year's highest-grossing Kannada film and her performance earned her the South Indian International Movie (SIIMA) Award for Best Debut Actress. Mandanna later revealed that if the film had failed, she would have had to return home to manage her father's business. Her commercial success was sustained with her 2017 releases—the action film Anjani Putra and the romantic comedy Chamak. In the former, The Indian Express felt that the actress had been reduced to \"a hero's arm candy\", but in the latter, Firstpost's Karthik Kermalu credited Mandanna with enhancing a mediocre picture. For Chamak, she received her first Best Actress nominations at the Filmfare Awards South and SIIMA.\n"

    "Expanding into Telugu cinema in 2018, Mandanna starred in the comedy drama Chalo, which follows a Tamil woman (Mandanna) who becomes romantically involved with a Telugu man (played by Naga Shaurya) in a segregated village. Initially struggling with the new language, Mandanna sought help from the film's assistant director who assisted her in improving her dialogue delivery. Reception to the film was mixed but Hemanth Kumar of Firstpost commended Mandanna on a \"terrific debut\" and Stivathsan Nadadhur from The Hindu appreciated her comic timing. Chalo emerged as her fourth consecutive box-office success in two years. Mandanna was next cast opposite Vijay Deverakonda in Venky Kudumula's romantic comedy Geetha Govindam. Made on a shoestring budget, the film became her first to cross ₹1 billion (US$13 million) at the domestic box-office, her highest-grosser at that point. Reviewers considered the chemistry between her and Deverakonda to be the highlight of an otherwise monotonous film. She earned the Filmfare Critics Award for Best Actress and gained a Best Actress nomination at the ceremony. Mandanna ended the year with the Telugu feature Devadas, in which she was dismissed as ornamental by reviewers for Sify and The Indian Express.\n",
    "The Kannada social action film Yajamana (2019) had a mixed reception from critics, with Film Companion's Karthik Keramalu criticising the noticeable age gap between Mandanna and Darshan, who is 19 years her senior\n"

    ". Regardless, it emerged as another commercial success for Mandanna. She reunited with Deverakonda for the Telugu romantic drama Dear Comrade in the role of an aspiring cricket player who faces sexism within the sport. Sashidhar Adivi of Deccan Chronicle commented that the role reflected a shift in Telugu cinema, where actresses were being given more substantial roles rather than serving purely as visual appeal. A departure from the previous lighthearted roles she had become accustomed to, Mandanna had to partake in five months of intensive physical training to accurately emulate a cricket player's body language. Despite high expectations following her previous collaboration with Deverakonda, Dear Comrade underperformed commercially. It also faced extensive criticism from audiences due to a scene featuring a kiss between the pair; In response, Mandanna stated that she was carrying out the script's demands and that a sole scene should not dictate the entire film. She later professed that she struggled with the online backlash that followed the film's release. Despite this, Yajamana and Dear Comrade won Mandanna Best Actress (Critics) awards at SIIMA in Kannada and Telugu, respectively, as well as additional Best Actress nominations in both languages at the ceremony.\n",

    "In 2021, Mandanna starred opposite Dhruva Sarja in Pogaru, which Vivek M V of Deccan Herald termed \"a riot of toxic masculinity\". In her second release of the year, she made her debut into Tamil cinema opposite Karthi in the action drama Sulthan. She expressed that working across languages is important to her, seeing it not as a barrier but as an opportunity to establish herself across industries. Though Hindustan Times' Haricharan Pudipeddi felt that Mandanna had been \"sidelined\", M Suganth of The Times of India praised her on a \"charming debut\". It emerged as a moderate commercial success.\n",
    "Her final appearance of 2021 was in the critically and commercially successful Telugu action film Pushpa: The Rise, starring Allu Arjun. For her role as a girl involved in the smuggling syndicate of red sandalwood, she learnt the Chittoor dialect of Telugu with support from a tutor. Film Companion's Mukesh Manjunath found that she did her \"best to imbue bubbliness and the innocence required in these testosterone-charged surroundings\" but lamented that the brown-facing of her character was \"unnecessary and ineffective\". Ranking among the highest-grossing Telugu films of all time, the film marked a breakthrough in Mandanna's career as she earned pan-India recognition for it—particularly for the song, \"Saami Saami\", which gained popularity\n"

    "The following year, Mandanna starred in a string of films with varying levels of success. She started with the unremarkable Telugu feature Aadavallu Meeku Johaarlu opposite Sharwanand. Keen to showcase her acting skills after a series of androcentric films, she took on a supporting role in the Dulquer Salmaan and Mrunal Thakur-led romantic drama Sita Ramam. Citing it as one of her better films, Sangeetha Devi Dundoo appreciated that Mandanna is \"given the scope to play a self-centred character\" and showed that she is willing to take on well-written roles. Against expectations, the film emerged as a success at the box-office and earned Mandanna her first nomination for Best Supporting Actress (Telugu) at Filmfare.\n",
    "Mandanna was set to debut in Hindi cinema with Mission Majnu, but delays meant her first appearance came instead in Vikas Bahl's family drama Goodbye, where she played a woman struggling with the aftermath of her mother's death (portrayed by Neena Gupta). She was initially hesitant to accept the role as the character's dismissive views on religious rituals clashed with her own beliefs, but Bahl's confidence in her abilities convinced her. The film was a financial failure. Renuka Vyavahare of The Times of India criticised Mandanna's Hindi diction but still felt she had managed to retain the essence of her Punjabi character\n"

    "The following year saw Mandanna star in three action films—Varisu, Mission Majnu and Animal. Varisu follows a young heir (played by Vijay) who takes over his family's business empire after his father's death, with Mandanna starring as his love interest. She labelled it a \"conscious choice\" to star in the film despite having a role \"with nothing to do\" as she was aware of the recognition Vijay's celebrity would bring her. M Suganth concurred that her role was insubstantial and dismissed her as merely ornamental. It emerged as a modest commercial success. The Hindi spy thriller Mission Majnu featuring Mandanna as a visually-impaired woman opposite Sidharth Malhotra as an Indian spy stationed in Pakistan during the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971, premiered digitally on Netflix following several delays in production. In preparation, she participated in intensive workshops to better her understanding on the behaviours of the visually-impaired and found it challenging not to be able to look Malhotra in the eyes during their scenes together. In a scathing review for Rediff.com, Sukanya Verma reviewed: \"Wearing a nose ring and smiling in response to everything is Rashmika's role in a nutshell\".\n",

The film's content led certain commentators to accuse the film of glorifying toxic masculinity and misogyny. WION's Shomini Sen praised Mandanna for salvaging a poorly-written character that had been constrained by Vanga's focus on \"a skewed version of an alpha male\". Mandanna defended her role in the film against criticism that her character condoned misogyny as she believed the character's actions stemmed from a desire to protect her family at any cost.

Nandini Ramnath of Scroll.in was appreciative of her chemistry with Allu Arjun and added that she \"has several strong sequences to justify her presence\" in an androcentric narrative. The Indian Express's Anandu Suresh was displeased with the hypersexualisation of her role, and took note of a prevailing theme in her filmography of playing the love interest of \"unnervingly eccentric\" men. Responding to criticism regarding her frequent roles in films glorifying toxic masculinity, Mandanna explained that such individuals exist in reality, and their hyperbolic depiction is a cinematic liberty intended to entertain audiences. Pushpa 2: The Rule set several box-office records for an Indian film, earning over ₹18 billion (US$210 million) worldwide to rank as Indian cinema's third biggest-grosser as well as Mandanna's highest grosser. For her performance, she earned her first Best Actress (Telugu) award at SIIMA.\n",
    "Mandanna had five releases in 2025, which began with Laxman Utekar's Hindi historical action film Chhaava, where she portrayed Maharani Yesubai Bhonsale opposite Vicky Kaushal as Maratha Chhatrapati Sambhaji. To prepare for their roles as Marathi royals, Kaushal and her spent four weeks learning Marathi. Reception to Mandanna's performance was generally negative with criticisim directed towards her poor Hindi diction\n"

Grossing over ₹8 billion (US$95 million), Chhaava emerged as the second highest-grossing Indian film of the year, making Mandanna the first Indian actress with three films crossing ₹5 billion (US$59 million) domestically. AR Murugadoss' Hindi action film Sikandar featured her opposite Salman Khan, who is 31 years her senior. In a negative review for Hindustan Times, Rishabh Suri dismissed her performance and persistently weak Hindi dialogue delivery. Sikandar failed to recoup its estimated production budget of ₹2 billion (US$24 million), after which Mandanna said that she does not measure success based on box-office numbers. Rahul Desai of The Hollywood Reporter noted a recurring theme in Mandanna's filmography of \"catering to the middle-class Indian patriarch’s biggest fantasy\" by playing subservient women whose sole purpose is to decorate their husband's masculinity and \"cook the carcass of female agency\". \n",
