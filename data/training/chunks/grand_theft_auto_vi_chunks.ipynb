    "Grand Theft Auto VI is an upcoming action-adventure game developed and published by Rockstar Games. It is due to be the eighth main Grand Theft Auto game, following Grand Theft Auto V (2013), and the sixteenth entry overall. Set within the fictional US state of Leonida, based on Florida, the story follows the romantic criminal duo of Jason Duval and Lucia Caminos. Players will be able to freely roam Leonida's open world, which predominantly features the Miami-inspired Vice City.\n",
    "Following years of speculation and anticipation, Rockstar confirmed in February 2022 that the game was in development. That September, footage from unfinished versions was leaked on the internet in what journalists described as one of the biggest leaks in the history of the video game industry. Grand Theft Auto VI was formally revealed in December 2023. Following several delays, it is scheduled to be released on 19 November 2026 for the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S.\n"

    "Grand Theft Auto VI is an action-adventure game set within an open world. Its fictional US state of Leonida, based on Florida, includes Vice City, Grassrivers, and the Leonida Keys, based on Miami, the Everglades, and the Florida Keys, respectively; as well as Ambrosia, Mount Kalaga National Park, and Port Gellhorn. The game world parodies 2020s American culture, with satirical depictions of social media and influencer culture, modern law enforcement tactics and technology such as police body cameras, and references to internet memes such as Florida Man.\n",
    "The story follows a criminal couple: Jason Duval, who worked for local drugrunners in the Leonida Keys after serving in the Army; and Lucia Caminos, the series's first non-optional female protagonist, who was imprisoned at Leonida Penitentiary after fighting for her family from Liberty City. Following a failed bank robbery, the duo encounter a state-wide conspiracy and are forced to protect each other. Other characters include: Cal Hampton, Jason's paranoid friend; Boobie Ike, who runs a business empire in Vice City; Dre'Quan Priest, owner of the record label Only Raw Records with Boobie; Bae-Luxe and Roxy, a musical duo signed to Only Raw under the name Real Dimez; Raul Bautista, a seasoned bank robber; and Brian Heder, a longtime drug runner and Jason's landlord.\n"

    "Rockstar Games began preliminary work on Grand Theft Auto VI in 2014 after Grand Theft Auto V's release, with early development starting in 2018 following Red Dead Redemption 2. Principal production began in 2020, code-named Project Americas. Jason Schreier reported the game was \"a moderately sized release\" that would expand over time to avoid its predecessors' developer crunch, and that it would feature two Bonnie and Clyde–inspired protagonists, including a Latina, and \"a significant online mode\" akin to Grand Theft Auto Online. He claimed the developers were cautiously subverting the series's trend of joking about marginalised groups. In 2018, The Know reported that the game would be set primarily in Vice City and partly in South America, and in 2021, Tom Henderson claimed its map could evolve akin to Fortnite. The game is expected to use the Rockstar Advanced Game Engine. It is the first main Grand Theft Auto game since the 1997 original (and the first overall since 2004's Advance) not to be written by Dan Houser, who left Rockstar in 2020.\n",
    "The game became highly anticipated in the years before its announcement, and journalists noted some fans became frustrated by Rockstar's continued silence, particularly after they announced a re-release of Grand Theft Auto V in 2020. An individual referring to the game received media attention for interrupting several live stage and television shows. On 4 February 2022, Rockstar confirmed development was \"well underway\"\n"

Industry sources stated Rockstar reallocated additional resources after planned remasters of Grand Theft Auto IV (2008) and Red Dead Redemption (2010) were paused due to the backlash received by Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy – The Definitive Edition (2021). Rumours suggested the budget surpassed $1–2 billion, making it the most expensive game ever developed, though the figure remained unverified.\n",
    "Grand Theft Auto VI won Most Wanted Game at the Golden Joystick Awards and Most Anticipated Game at the Game Awards in both 2024 and 2025. Anticipation spawned an internet meme indicating bemusement that other surprising events occurred \"before GTA 6\". Several publishers awaited a release date announcement before scheduling their own games, with others prepared to reschedule to avoid competition; Schreier called it \"a massive game of 4D chess playing out across the entire video-game industry\". Some industry figures hope it is sold for US$80 to $100—more than the standard $70—as it would prompt industry-wide changes, but analysts consider it unlikely as a higher price could lead to fewer sales\n"

Circana predicted Grand Theft Auto VI and the Nintendo Switch 2 could \"rebound\" the market with record consumer spending; DFC Intelligence projected sales of 40 million and earnings of $3.2 billion in the first year—doubling Grand Theft Auto V, which had the highest-grossing game launch—including $1 billion in preorders.\n",
    "Rockstar requested employees cease remote work and return to offices from April 2024 \"for productivity and security\" in development's \"final stages\". The Independent Workers' Union of Great Britain (IWGB) criticised Rockstar for contradicting their promise to maintain flexible working conditions; some employees were concerned it could negatively affect staff health and morale and prompt resignations and crunch. Kotaku's Zack Zwiezen reported the decision was partly to avoid a delay, though other journalists and Rockstar's parent company, Take-Two Interactive, said the game remained on schedule for late 2025. The amount of remaining work led employees to expect a delay; in May 2025, the game was delayed to 26 May 2026.\n",

Several fans criticised the delay, with some saying they were losing interest, though others felt it would be worth the wait. Take-Two's stock price dropped by about 10% before starting to rebound. Several companies responded to the news with memes and support, and the Polish politician Witold Tumanowicz joked about the delay in a Sejm session.

    "On 18 September 2022, a user known as \"teapotuberhacker\" published 90 videos to the website GTAForums showing 50 minutes of work-in-progress game footage. Schreier confirmed with sources at Rockstar that the footage was genuine, and The Guardian reported it was from several stages of development, with some videos about a year old. The footage revealed a modern-day Vice City setting, contained animation and gameplay tests, level layouts, and character conversations, and depicted the player characters, Lucia and Jason, entering a strip club and robbing a diner. The hacker claimed to be responsible for the Uber security breach from the prior week, said they had downloaded the files directly from Rockstar's internal Slack groups, and threatened to publish source code, assets, and internal builds of Grand Theft Auto V and VI.\n",
    "Take-Two responded by submitting takedowns of videos showing or discussing the leaks hosted on YouTube, and contacted GTAForums and Reddit moderators to remove access. The hacker wrote they were \"looking to negotiate a deal\" with Rockstar or Take-Two. Journalists described the event as one of the biggest leaks in video game history; Schreier called it \"a nightmare for Rockstar Games\" which could limit employees' remote-work flexibility. The Jefferies Group analyst Andrew Uerkwitz called it a \"PR disaster\" that could potentially delay the game and diminish staff morale, but was unlikely to impact reception or sales\n"

    ". The Guardian noted the leaked footage was being widely criticised \"by ill-informed users\" due to its quality, despite not being representative of the final product. Some users erroneously claimed graphics and art assets are finalised early in game development. In solidarity, several developers shared work-in-progress footage of their games and some, including Cliff Bleszinski, Neil Druckmann, Rami Ismail, and Alanah Pearce, offered sympathies to Rockstar.\n",
    "On 19 September, Rockstar confirmed the leak to be a \"network intrusion\" and lamented the manner in which the game was first demonstrated, but did not anticipate long-term effects on development. They disabled comments and replies on their social media accounts in the days following the leak. Take-Two added that steps had been taken \"to isolate and contain this incident\". Take-Two's share price dropped by more than 6% in pre-market trading that day, but recovered during regular trading hours following their statement. Uber acknowledged the potential links to their security breach and noted they were working with the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the United States Department of Justice. They believed the hacker was affiliated with the group Lapsus$, which was thought to have breached companies such as Microsoft, Nvidia, and Samsung over the preceding year\n"

Rockstar later claimed the incident cost the company $5 million and thousands of staff hours to recover.\n",
    "A 17-year-old boy from Oxfordshire—identified as \"teapotuberhacker\" and a key member of Lapsus$—was arrested by the City of London Police on 22 September as part of an investigation supported by the National Cyber Crime Unit and American federal law enforcement. While on bail for hacking EE and Nvidia and under police protection at a Travelodge hotel, he breached Rockstar using a mobile phone, television, and an Amazon Fire TV Stick and threatened to release the source code in a Slack message to all Rockstar staff. Appearing before Highbury Corner Youth Court, he pleaded guilty to two counts of breaching bail conditions and not guilty to two counts of computer misuse. The case was referred to a higher court while the boy was remanded to a young offender institution. In mid-2023, he stood trial at Southwark Crown Court for twelve offences, including six counts of computer misuse, three of blackmail, and two of fraud. He was deemed unfit to stand trial due to his autism; instead of assessing his guilt, a jury determined he had committed the acts\n"

    "On 1 January 2025, a Reddit user posted a photograph and two videos of a PlayStation 5 development kit running the game, taken by a person who \"worked at the Rockstar office for a few months\" in mid-2021; the post was later deleted. Based on the office's surroundings, Eurogamer determined the photograph and videos were taken at Rockstar San Diego. Polygon's Ian Walker found no new information was revealed from the post, which he called the \"worst leak of all time\". Many considered the opening of the second trailer in May 2025—wherein Jason is \"just fixing some leaks\"—a reference to the game's leaks. In November, footage imitating the game received millions of views before the creator admitted it was a deepfake. Later that week, some development footage was spotted in a former Rockstar animator's demo reel.\n"
