    "In a world inhabited by anthropomorphic animals, Judy Hopps, a rabbit from rural Bunnyburrow, fulfills her childhood dream of becoming the first rabbit police officer in the city of Zootopia. On her first day at the Zootopia Police Department (ZPD), Judy is given parking duty by police chief Bogo and is hustled by red fox con artist Nick Wilde during her shift. The next day, while Bogo is reprimanding Judy for abandoning her post, Mrs. Otterton visits his office, pleading for someone to find her husband, Emmitt, one of several \"predators\" who have gone missing. Without seeking prior approval, Judy volunteers, and Bogo attempts to dismiss her for insubordination. When the city's assistant mayor, Dawn Bellwether, praises Judy for taking the assignment, Bogo reluctantly agrees but demands Judy's resignation if she cannot close the case within 48 hours.\n",
    "Having ascertained that Nick was the last to see Emmitt, Judy blackmails him into helping her by recording his confession to tax evasion. Tracking a limousine that picked up Emmitt, they learn the vehicle is owned by Mr. Big, an arctic shrew mafia boss whom Nick has a history with. Mr. Big explains that Emmitt unexpectedly \"went savage\" and mindlessly attacked the limousine's chauffeur Renato Manchas, a black jaguar. Judy and Nick question Manchas, who explains that Emmitt yelled about \"Night Howlers\" before attacking him. Manchas also suddenly turns savage and pursues them\n"

Nick later reveals to Judy that, as a child, he was bullied by his peers due to their prejudiced beliefs about foxes.\n",

Following the wolves, Judy and Nick locate Emmitt and the other missing predators, who are all \"savage\" and imprisoned in an asylum. Zootopia's mayor, Leodore Lionheart, had ordered the quarantine and is trying to determine what is causing their feral behavior. Lionheart and the asylum staff are arrested and Bellwether becomes the new mayor. Judy, praised for solving the case, invites Nick to join the ZPD as her partner. At a press conference, Judy carelessly implies that the predators' physiology caused the savageness epidemic. Disappointed and offended, Nick abandons Judy, and her comments incite fear and discrimination against predators throughout Zootopia. Wracked with guilt, Judy resigns from the ZPD and returns to Bunnyburrow.\n",

They find Doug in his laboratory hidden in the subway, where he manufactures a serum from the Night Howlers to use against predators via a dart gun. Judy and Nick seize the gun as evidence after a pursuit in the subway, but before they can reach the ZPD, Bellwether confronts them in a Natural History Museum, revealing herself to have masterminded a prey-supremacist conspiracy. Bellwether traps Judy and Nick in an exhibit and attempts to infect Nick, but the duo had managed beforehand to replace the serum with blueberries and record Bellwether's confession. \n",

    "Development of the film that became Zootopia began when Byron Howard had pitched six story ideas to Disney Animation chief creative officer and executive producer John Lasseter, of which three involved animal characters: an all-animal adaptation of The Three Musketeers, a 1960s-themed story about a \"mad doctor cat...who turned children into animals\", and a \"bounty hunter pug in space\". The common thread running through these ideas was that Howard wanted to do a film similar to Disney's Robin Hood, which also featured animals in anthropomorphic roles. According to Howard, Zootopia emerged from his desire to create something different from other animal anthropomorphic films, where animals either live in the natural world or in the human world. His concept, in which animals live in a modern world designed by animals for animals, was well received by Lasseter, who responded by embracing and lifting Howard \"in the air like a baby Simba\". Lasseter suggested that Howard should try combining the 1960s theme with the animal characters, especially the space pug. This led Howard to develop and pitch Savage Seas, an international spy film centered on an arctic hare named \"Jack Savage\" who was somewhat like James Bond\n"

    ". It was around this time that screenwriter Jared Bush was hired to work on the film; he was excited to work on a spy film because his own father and grandfather had worked for the Central Intelligence Agency.\n",
    "Howard and Bush continued to develop the film with the assistance of the Disney Story Trust, the studio's top creative personnel who meet regularly to review and discuss all projects in development. The most delightful part of the spy film turned out to be its first act, set in a city created by and for animals. To focus on the all-animal city, Howard eventually dropped the 1960s setting, along with the espionage and international aspects, and changed the film into a contemporary police procedural in which Nick Wilde was the lead role and Judy Hopps was essentially his sidekick. For a while, \"the filmmakers were very committed\" to that version of the story, but then in November 2014, the filmmakers realized the film's plot would be more engaging if they reversed the roles to instead focus on Hopps as opposed to Wilde. The change in perspective involved dropping several characters, including two characters known as \"The Gerbil Jerks\" who were described as \"trust-fund gerbils that had nothing better to do than harass Nick.\"\n"

    "Research for the film took place in Disney's Animal Kingdom, as well as in Kenya and the San Diego Zoo Safari Park, where animators spent eight months studying various animals' walk cycles as well as fur color. Eight hundred thousand forms of mammals were created for and featured in the film. To make the characters' fur even more realistic, they also went to the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County to closely observe the appearance of fur with a microscope under a variety of lighting. The filmmakers drew inspiration for Zootopia's urban design from major cities including New York City, San Francisco, Las Vegas, Paris, Shanghai, Hong Kong, and Brasília. To develop a city that could actually be inhabited by talking mammals ranging in size from two inches (5.1 cm) to 27 feet (8.2 m) and from drastically different climates, the filmmakers consulted Americans with Disabilities Act specialists and HVAC system designers. For assistance with designing motor vehicles appropriate for so many different types and sizes of mammals, the filmmakers consulted with J Mays, former chief creative officer of the Ford Motor Company.

    "Disney's most recent work on animating fur was for the titular character of the 2008 film Bolt, but the software they had used at the time was not ready for creating the realistic fur of the animals of Zootopia. Therefore, the studio's IT engineers developed the fur-controlling software \"iGroom\", which gave character designers precise control over the brushing, shaping, and shading of fur and made it possible to create a variety of eccentric character styles for each animal. The software was also able to control an unseen \"imaginary\" under-layer that gave fur a degree of plushness not seen before. This feature was used to create characters like Officer Clawhauser, who has a big head that is entirely made of spotted fur. Characters with noteworthy numbers of strands of hair or fur included both of the two lead characters, Judy Hopps and Nick Wilde, who each had around 2.5 million hairs; a giraffe with nine million strands of fur; a gerbil with 480,000 strands; and a rodent with more strands of hair than the 400,000 that were on Elsa's head in Frozen.\n",
    "Zootopia was the second time Disney used the Hyperion renderer, which they had first used on Big Hero 6. A new fur paradigm was added to the renderer to facilitate the creation of realistic images of the animals' dense fur\n"

Nitro, a real-time display application developed since the making of Wreck-It Ralph, was used to make the fur more consistent, intact, and subtle much more quickly, as opposed to the previous practice of having to predict how the fur would work while making and looking at silhouettes or poses for the character.

    "On May 6, 2015, Bateman and Ginnifer Goodwin were announced as having been cast, respectively, in the roles of Nick Wilde and Judy Hopps. The filmmakers chose Bateman because they wanted an actor who could bring \"a funny yet heartfelt side\" with \"a wily, dry-witted sort of voice\". Bateman described his character as \"a crafty, sarcastic schemer\", remarking on the role's similarity to many other roles he had done since he was 12. He explained that he had said to the directors: \"'What kind of voice do you guys want me to do?' And they just looked at me like I was an idiot and said, 'Just do what you do. Just talk.'\"\n",
    "Commenting on the casting of Goodwin, Moore said that she brought \"very centered sweetness, tremendous heart and a great sense of humor\"; he described Judy as \"a little Pollyanna mixed with Furiosa\". Goodwin stated about her character: \"People mistake kindness for naïveté or stupidity, and she is a good girl through and through. But she's not a dumb bunny.\"\n"

On April 5, it became the first film of 2016 to gross over $800 million in ticket sales, and on April 24, became the first film of 2016 to cross $900 million. On June 5, the film crossed the $1 billion mark, becoming the second film of 2016 to do so (after the studio's own Captain America: Civil War), the fourth animated film (after Toy Story 3, Frozen and Minions), the eleventh Disney film, the third Disney animated film, and the twenty-sixth film overall to reach the milestone.\n",
    "Worldwide, it was the fourth-highest-grossing film of 2016 (behind Civil War, Rogue One, and Finding Dory), the second-highest-grossing animated film of 2016, the second-highest-grossing Walt Disney Animation Studios film (second-highest overall) of all time in its original release (after Frozen), the second-highest-grossing original film (behind Avatar), and the fourth-highest-grossing animated film of all time.

On March 27, its seventeenth day of release, it passed the $200 million mark, becoming the first animated film, the second Disney film, and the sixth Hollywood film overall to pass that milestone. It became the highest-grossing animated film of all time and the second-highest-grossing film of 2016, behind only The Mermaid.\n",
    "It opened in Japan on April 23 and earned $4 million in its opening weekend, debuting at second place in the box office, behind Detective Conan: The Darkest Nightmare, and had the third-biggest Walt Disney Animation Studios debut in that market, behind Frozen and Big Hero 6. Deadline.com pointed out that the average opening number might have been due to the 2016 Kumamoto earthquakes, which could have affected moviegoers. In a rare achievement, it topped the box office in its third weekend after two weeks at No. 2. In the following two weekends, it continued to increase its ticket sales, and topped the box office there for four consecutive weekends. After four straight wins, it was finally overtaken by the R-rated superhero film Deadpool. It was the No. 1 western/Hollywood film for eight consecutive weekends\n"

On Metacritic, the film has a score of 78 out of 100, based on 43 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A\" on an A+ to F scale, while those surveyed by PostTrak gave it a 90% overall positive score, with 87% saying they would \"definitely recommend\" it.\n",
    "Neil Genzlinger of The New York Times considered the movie \"funny, smart, [and] thought-provoking\". Peter Travers of Rolling Stone wrote that Zootopia \"may be the most subversive movie of\" 2016, giving the film three-and-a-half stars out of four and praising its timely message about the harm of prejudice in the face of the prevailing xenophobic political rhetoric at the time of the film's release, and the film's humor. Peter Debruge at Variety opined that Zootopia \"plays directly to the studio's strength\"\n"

    "Writing in British Sunday newspaper The Observer, reviewer Mark Kermode: Very funny, and very likable holiday treat... The ensuing drama is nominally a tale of predators succumbing to their animal instincts while frightened prey fear their neighbours. In fact, it's a delightfully well-orchestrated parable about trust and tolerance versus panic and prejudice. An encouragingly upbeat celebration of love and diversity in times of hate and uncertainty. If that all sounds overly on-message, then fear not—the jokes are funny, the characters engaging, and the animation packed with delicious visual detail... this is proper family fun with genuine cross-generational appeal. Hooray!\n",
    "In the UK daily newspaper The Daily Telegraph, Robbie Collin noted, \"The lion doesn't just lie down with the lamb, they run for City Hall on a joint ticket. It's the diversity dream come true. Or is it? […] Think Busytown by way of Chinatown. It's almost certain to be the most existentially probing talking animal cartoon of the year.\" Collin added, \"Like Nick Nolte and Eddie Murphy in 48 Hrs., albeit considerably cuter, Judy and Nick make a hilariously strained but effective double act – not least thanks to Goodwin and Bateman's tremendous vocal work, which trips along with the effortless swing and snap of great bebop.\"\n"

    "Matt Zoller Seitz of RogerEbert.com, despite generally liking the film (three out of four stars), had trouble with the film's central metaphor that conflicted with its message: Zootopia is constantly asking its characters to look past species stereotypes, and not use species-ist language or repeat hurtful assumptions. This all seems clever and noble until you realize that all the stereotypes about various animals are to some extent true, in particular the most basic one carnivores eat herbivores because it's in their nature. If Zootopia were a bit vaguer, or perhaps dumber and less pleased with itself, it might have been a classic, albeit of a very different, less reputable sort. As-is, it's a goodhearted, handsomely executed film that doesn't add up in the way it wants to.\n",
    "Also in The Daily Telegraph, Rosa Prince singled out the film's lead character, Judy Hopps, as a welcome change for Disney animated feature film heroines, such as the Disney Princess franchise. She found that unlike those characters' focus on romance or family loyalty, Hopps' focus is on her dream career as a police officer and serving her city.\n",

    "On March 21, 2017, a copyright infringement lawsuit was filed against Disney by Esplanade Productions, a company owned by Gary L. Goldman, the co-screenwriter of Total Recall. The lawsuit claims that Goldman (in 2000 and 2009) pitched a concept to Disney for a live-action film titled Looney, which was about a socially awkward animator who creates a self-inspired TV cartoon called Zootopia. Disney twice rejected the pitch, but Goldman accused the company of copying the name, themes, settings, and character tropes. Filed with the lawsuit was a graphic of early concept artwork of characters that are claimed to appear similar to major characters from the film, including Nick Wilde, Judy Hopps, Flash, and Chief Bogo. A Disney spokesperson described the lawsuit as being \"ridden with patently false allegations\". After months of back-and-forth deliberation between the two parties, U.S. District Judge Michael W. Fitzgerald dismissed the infringement claims on November 8, 2017. As stated in the final review, \"Goldman's effort to make the plots of Looney and Zootopia seem similar were strained. All the purported similarities between the two works were themes, not plot points or sequences of events, that were too general to be protected by copyright law.\" Esplanade appealed to the Ninth Circuit, which affirmed the dismissal on April 24, 2019.\n"

It was announced to be an anthology series that would feature storylines that follow 3 sets of characters from the film (the mobster shrews, the tiger dancers, and the sloths). On November 12, 2021, Disney confirmed the series for a release in 2022, and also released a first-look teaser image which included characters from the film not previously confirmed to be in the series. The series was directed by Trent Correy and Josie Trinidad. It was released on November 9, 2022 with six shorts.\n",
    "Among the episodes include an action parody starring Bonnie and Stu Hopps, a musical starring Duke Weaselton, a Real Housewives spoof with Fru-Fru, a film noir parody with Mr. Big, a dance competition parody with Clawhauser, Bogo, and Gazelle, and a romantic comedy parody with Flash and Priscilla. Judy Hopps and Nick Wilde cameo in the action parody and make other appearances throughout. All the cast members from the movie reprised their roles. The music is composed by Curtis Strong and Mick Giacchino (Michael's son), with Michael scoring the \"Duke the Musical\" episode with lyrics by Kate Anderson and Elyssa Samsel (Olaf's Frozen Adventure, Central Park).\n"

On February 8, 2023, Disney CEO Bob Iger announced that a sequel to Zootopia was in the works during the Disney 2023 Q1 investors call. Later that day, screenwriter and co-director Jared Bush confirmed that he is working on the film as director and writer, while Josie Trinidad, who had served as head of story for the first film alongside Jim Reardon, was confirmed as the sequel's co-director, making it her feature directorial debut. Ginnifer Goodwin, who voices Judy, told CinemaBlend that she would like to see a role reversal between Judy and Nick in the sequel. \"I would like to see Nick have to be the one to convince Judy that the world is worth fighting for,\" she said. Jason Bateman, who voices Nick, also told CinemaBlend about his idea for the sequel: \"The two of us [Nick and Judy] kicking ass out there. Cleaning up the streets. We're a couple of new cops out there. So, bad guys, be warned.\" On February 7, 2024, Iger revealed during the Disney 2024 Q1 investors call that the sequel has been titled Zootopia 2, and will be released on November 26, 2025. On August 9, 2024, Ke Huy Quan was announced to be playing Gary, while Bush will be the sole writer and director of the film instead with Yvett Merino set to produce.\n"
