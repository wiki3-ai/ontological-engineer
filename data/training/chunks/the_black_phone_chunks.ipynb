    "The Black Phone is a 2021 American supernatural horror film directed by Scott Derrickson from a screenplay he wrote with C. Robert Cargill, based on the 2004 short story by Joe Hill. It is the first installment in the Black Phone franchise. It stars Mason Thames as Finney, a teenage boy abducted by a serial child killer known colloquially as the Grabber (Ethan Hawke). When Finney encounters a mystical black rotary phone in captivity, he uses it to plot his escape by communicating with the ghosts of the Grabber's slain victims. Madeleine McGraw, Jeremy Davies, and James Ransone also feature in the principal cast. Derrickson and Cargill produced The Black Phone in association with Blumhouse Productions CEO Jason Blum. Universal Pictures oversaw the film's commercial distribution, and funding was sourced through a pact with Blumhouse and tax subsidies from the North Carolina state government.\n",
    "The idea of The Black Phone arose from Derrickson and Cargill's adaptation of the eponymous short story by Hill, found in 20th Century Ghosts. Derrickson struggled to produce additional ideas that supplemented the short story, shifting his attention to other filmmaking endeavors. The film remained dormant until he resigned from Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness (2022) over creative differences. Derrickson used his childhood experiences in suburban Denver, Colorado, to develop The Black Phone story\n"

    "In 1978, a local serial child abductor and murderer, known only as \"The Grabber,\" prowls the streets of a suburb in North Denver, Colorado. Finney Blake and his younger sister, Gwen, live in the area with their abusive, alcoholic father, Terrence, whose wife died by suicide after having a series of disturbing psychic dreams. Finney is frequently bullied and harassed at school, but his friend and classmate, Robin, fends off the bullies.\n",
    "Having inherited her mother's ability, Gwen dreams about the Grabber's abduction of Bruce, a boy Finney knew from Little League. Police detectives, Wright and Miller, interview Gwen at school, believing she may know the Grabber. When Terrence learns about the questioning, he beats Gwen. Soon afterward, the Grabber abducts Robin and then Finney.\n",
    "Finney awakens in a soundproofed basement with a disconnected black rotary dial telephone on one wall. It begins to ring on its own at times; Finney hears only static when he first answers it, but then hears Bruce's voice telling him about a floor tile he can remove to dig an escape tunnel. Finney starts to dig, but the house's foundations are too deep for him to go beneath them.\n",
    "The Grabber brings Finney a meal and leaves the basement door unlocked. As Finney is about to sneak out, he gets a call from Billy, another past victim. Billy warns Finney that the Grabber is waiting at the top of the basement stairs to beat him with a belt until he passes out if he tries to leave, as part of a cruel game\n"

    "The Black Phone emerged from filmmakers Scott Derrickson and C. Robert Cargill's adaptation of Joe Hill's short story of the same name, published in the horror anthology 20th Century Ghosts (2005). Derrickson came across 20th Century Ghosts shortly after its initial US release. The director was eager to conceive a film faithful to \"The Black Phone\", which fascinated him in its framing of a conventional serial killer story, but struggled to produce ideas of his own devising. He shelved the project to focus on his professional relationship with Cargill, forged from Sinister (2012) and his contractual obligations to Marvel Studios as director of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) film Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness (2022). Cargill briefly pitched for a replacement director in the interim, stopping once Derrickson convinced him to wait until he was available to commit. Their collaboration resumed after Derrickson resigned from the Doctor Strange (2016) sequel over disputes about the film's artistic direction.\n",
    "To bolster The Black Phone's story, Derrickson used his upbringing in suburban Denver, Colorado, as a major source of inspiration. He gleaned from people in his everyday life to shape the characters, their circumstances, and the film's depiction of suburbia, including a child whose mother was raped, murdered, and disposed of in a lake wrapped in phone wire\n"

    "Agents scouted hundreds of child actors for The Black Phone's starring roles. They ultimately hired Mason Thames and Madeleine McGraw as the first significant casting choices, from auditions conducted on Zoom as a result of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. McGraw was considered among four actresses, and when a prior commitment to Disney's television series Secrets of Sulphur Springs forced her to pull out, the producers postponed filming of The Black Phone by several months to accommodate her schedule. Casting for Finney was not as immediate of an undertaking. It took months for the filmmakers to survey the actors—first through talent agencies in New York and Los Angeles, then an open call—before they were shown Thames's demo reels. Even though Thames lacked acting experience, The Black Phone being his film debut, he reportedly stood apart from others in his ability to emote and take direction. Due to the amount of violence and profanity in the script, Derrickson carefully broached the subject to Thames, McGraw, and their parents in preparation for scenes.\n",
    "By early 2021, the starring cast featured Jeremy Davies, Ethan Hawke, and James Ransone, the latter two in their second film with Derrickson after Sinister. The director and Cargill did not envision one particular actor as The Grabber in their original character treatments, but sent Hawke the script because they had a rapport. Hawke was disinclined to play villainous parts as he feared being typecast\n"

    "Principal photography began on February 9, 2021, in Wilmington, North Carolina, under the pseudonym Static. A private residence used for interior and exterior shots was the shoot's initial location. The production base was confined mostly to EUE/Screen Gems's local film studio, from sets portraying The Grabber's basement, and adjacent neighborhoods. Estimates to realize the shoot ran between $16–18 million, the budget partially funded by a $4.7 million transferable tax credit on in-state costs from the North Carolina government. Elsewhere regionally, shooting occurred in New Hanover, Brunswick, and Columbus counties. Filming for The Black Phone ended on March 27, 2021.\n",
    "Brett Jutkiewicz was The Black Phone's director of photography. Jutkiewicz had just finished filming Scream (2022) when he received the script from his agent. Derrickson approached him in mid-December 2020 to discuss ideas raised from Jutkiewicz's reading of The Black Phone script. They also bonded from discussing Jutkiewicz's work in the satirical horror film Ready or Not (2019), which had impressed Derrickson. After an interviewing period, the producers formally contracted Jutkiewicz that January. Derrickson's instruction was to implement a look evoking the 1970s period in which the film is set. The production used source material, such as New York-set 1970s movies, not so much to glean textural ideas as to establish the appropriate tone for the setting and storytelling\n"

    ". This, according to Jutkiewicz, meant experimenting with color grading techniques to produce a high contrast, muted, but not desaturated, visual palette. To achieve this image quality, and to reduce the picture's range of hues, filmmakers mixed colors using specialized lookup tables (LUT). The choice of LUTs was contingent on the brightness of sets; for example, Jutkiewicz employed a darker LUT to preserve the image palette of dimly-lit basement scenes.\n",
    "The camera crew shot the dream sequences in Super 8 format, an established practice of Derrickson's repertoire, using Bolex cameras. They prepared by testing the utility of footage in Kodak's color negative film stock—the Vision3 500T 5219/7219, Vision3 50D 7203, and Vision3 250D 5207/7207. Lighting determined the film stock deployed for the shooting. Jutkiewicz said that he at first struggled working in Super 8 format as he had to reacquaint with old filmmaking methods.\n"

    "VFX Legion was responsible for The Black Phone's visual effects, in their second project with Derrickson. Development of the visual effects began in pre-production, under the supervision of VFX Legion co-founders James David Hattin and Nate Smalley. Their work for the film comprised 200 shots of matte and digital compositing effects, such as green screening, set extensions, superimposed practical stunt effects, camera transitions, computer-generated imagery (CGI), and rig removal. Maya, Nuke, Houdini, and Redshift were among the software used to handle rendering and animation tasks. VFX Legion was also present on set to critique the shoot and rectify problems with the filmmaking.\n",
    "One of the special effect team's most complex assignments was rendering the stunt of a Grabber victim's violent retreat to the spiritual realm. VFX Legion supervisor Ken Johnson managed the scene's filming on set. VFX Legion then developed a digital model of the actor from a 3D scan animated with retopologized graphics and textures, allowing them to employ ragdoll physics for fluid movement. This was a labor-intensive process because the filmmakers wanted the movement of the digital model to project a loss of control, and the stunt's combined animation to be slow enough to show that the victim was being forced into a void. Another challenging sequence saw VFX Legion modify in-home tracking shots with CGI, which entailed altering the frame rate of footage to maintain a continuously steady speed.\n"

    "Designing The Grabber's masks became a core goal, in part because Blumhouse Productions planned to showcase them in ads for the film. While the script detailed a prototype of two worn leather masks painted with a smiling and a frowning devil, this concept evolved when Derrickson proposed the addition of a mouthless mask. They convey despair, joy, and nihility in exaggerated form, reminiscent of tragic comic masks of ancient Greek theatre. Derrickson and Blumhouse producer Ryan Turek solicited five visual effects companies for the mask-making, including Callosum Studios, a Pittsburgh-based studio founded by prosthetic makeup artists Jason Baker and Tom Savini. Of the illustrations submitted, Callosum's most closely resembled the vision of the producers. Savini and Baker were engaged to handle the creation of up to 30 masks for gags, stunts, specific scenes, and pandemic mitigation, in a process that lasted a month. The approval of sketches took about two weeks, followed by the construction of pieces in about a day or two. The filmmakers drew on diverse material for reference, among them ceramic masks, circus masks, antique dolls, William Hickey's Coney Island Barker, the horror film Mr. Sardonicus (1961), and the exaggerated grin of Conrad Veidt's Gwynplaine in the silent film The Man Who Laughs (1928).\n",
    "Derrickson imagined the mouthless mask after Hawke was hired, since he wanted the actor's face to be partially displayed in some of The Black Phone\n"

    ". He developed the design further by envisioning scenarios that examined The Grabber's motivations, his choice of masks in interactions with Finney, et cetera. The fully realized concept surfaced from Savini's original sketches, at which point the filmmakers began contemplating age, consistency, and the application of each mask. They constructed the pieces from moldings of procured life masks of Hawke's face, a task complicated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Callosum conducted the face casting sessions in Hawke's home office in New York because the actor was not comfortable traveling. They then sculpted masks from their Pittsburgh studio before returning to New York for test fittings. The finished pieces were created from a fiberglass-resin mixture paneled with felt and foam padding. As well, the filmmakers constructed replicas for stunts out of lightweight rubber and latex.\n"

It finished its festival itinerary at the 2022 Tribeca Festival, part of the fest's late-night lineup. Universal Pictures released The Black Phone in US theaters on June 24, 2022, after delaying the film twice from its scheduled early 2022 release. The studio's marketing campaign promoted the viewing experience rather than the film's actors or story elements. They began the promotional cycle in August 2021 with a trade show exhibit at CinemaCon, where the first teaser trailer debuted. The official trailer was released in October 2021.

    "The Black Phone was considered a surprise box office success, as studios anticipated meager profits for theaters screening lower-budget films, closed as a consequence of COVID-19 pandemic control measures. The film finished its theatrical run grossing $90.1 million in the United States and Canada (55.8% of its earnings) and $71.3 million internationally (44.2%), for a global total of $161.4 million. Of this figure, $67.8 million was estimated to have been yielded by Blumhouse and Universal in net profit, factoring in advertising, production, interest, administrative overhead, residuals, and miscellaneous costs.\n",
    "After securing $3 million from advanced screenings, the film received a wide release across 3,150 theaters in the United States. It opened as the fourth-highest-grossing movie of the week with $23.3 million, moderately exceeding the pre-release estimates of $15–20 million. About $1.7 million of this figure came from Los Angeles-area cinemas alone. New York, Dallas, Chicago, Houston, Atlanta, San Francisco, Phoenix, Philadelphia, and Washington also represented much of the film's biggest takings. Exit polling conducted during opening night revealed the average opinion moviegoers gave the film was positive, ranging from a B+ on CinemaScore to an 86% score on PostTrak. Audiences skewed younger, and the main reasons given to see the film were the trailer, the Blumhouse connection, and Hawke\n"

In the fourth weekend, the film slipped further to the number seven position with a gross of $5.3 million, its theater count narrowing to 2,271. The Black Phone remained one of the top ten highest-grossing films for seven consecutive weeks. By August 2022, the film's domestic gross topped $85.8 million.\n",
    "The Black Phone debuted overseas grossing $13.4 million from 45 countries, for a total sum of $35.8 million. Mexico comprised the largest portion of earnings with $3.4 million, reportedly one of the country's all-time biggest-opening grosses for a horror film, followed by the United Kingdom ($1.7 million), the Middle East ($1.4 million, including $700,000 from Saudi Arabia), France ($800,000), and Spain ($600,000). Second week earnings dropped by just 28% to $8.3 million, thanks to the film's continued global rollout and sustained momentum in Mexico, Europe, and Saudi Arabia. Expansion into Australia ($1.54 million), Brazil ($1.3 million), and several overseas markets buoyed The Black Phone's performance in the week of July 24, grossing $6.9 million. By September 11, the film's offshore gross exceeded $69.7 million.\n"

    "The Black Phone opened to mostly favorable reviews. On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 81% of 271 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 7.0/10. The website's consensus reads: \"The Black Phone might have been even more frightening, but it remains an entertaining, well-acted adaptation of scarily good source material.\" Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 65 out of 100, based on 38 critics, indicating \"generally favorable\" reviews.\n",
    "A commonly discussed aspect in the media was the scriptwriting. They were inclined to compare The Black Phone to Hill's short story based on tone and style, with critics saying the film script augmented ideas faithful to the source material. Another point of notice was the script's treatment of a traditional serial killer story in the approach and period setting, which Chicago Sun-Times stated made for \"one of the better cinematic nightmares in recent years\". On the other hand, the media differed over the handling of ideas, often singling out the film's supernatural elements for further scrutiny, with one review from Variety claiming its emphasis undermined tension-building in the story. Others felt that The Black Phone's depicted concept fell short of their expectation. Plodding characterization and pacing was ascribed to mistakes in the writing, although the Los Angeles Times singled out intense basement-set conversational scenes with Finney as the film's most compelling moments\n"
