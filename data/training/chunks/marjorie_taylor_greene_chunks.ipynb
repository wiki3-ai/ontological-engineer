    "Marjorie Taylor Greene (born May 27, 1974), also known by her initials MTG, is an American politician, businesswoman, and conspiracy theorist who has served as the U.S. representative for Georgia's 14th congressional district since 2021. A member of the Republican Party, she was elected to Congress in 2020 following the retirement of Republican incumbent Tom Graves and was reelected in 2022 and 2024. Greene is widely considered to be a populist and far-right politician.\n",
    "Greene has promoted Islamophobic, antisemitic, and white supremacist views including the white genocide conspiracy theory, as well as QAnon, and Pizzagate. She has amplified conspiracy theories that allege government involvement in mass shootings in the United States, implicate the Clinton family in murder, and suggest the attacks of 9/11 were a hoax. Before running for Congress, Greene supported calls to execute prominent Democratic Party politicians, including Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama. As a congresswoman, she equated the Democratic Party with Nazis, and compared COVID-19 safety measures to the persecution of Jews during the Holocaust, later apologizing for this comparison. During the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Greene promoted Russian propaganda and praised its president Vladimir Putin. Greene identifies as a Christian nationalist.\n",
    "A vocal advocate of President Donald Trump during his first presidency, Greene aided and supported his attempts to overturn the 2020 U.S\n"

Eleven Republicans joined unanimous Democrats in the vote. Greene was appointed to new committee roles in January 2023. In June 2023, Greene was expelled from the conservative House Freedom Caucus after insulting fellow caucus member Congresswoman Lauren Boebert. Greene unsuccessfully attempted to oust Mike Johnson from his role as Speaker of the House of Representatives on May 8, 2024.\n",

As of 2019, Greene and Perry were the company's vice president and president, respectively. Greene was listed as the chief financial officer of Taylor Commercial from 2007 to 2011, but a 2021 Atlanta Journal-Constitution investigation determined that she had no significant presence at the company. In 2011, Greene stepped down as the company's CFO and began CrossFit training.\n",

Greene left the business in early 2017. In a 2015 interview, Greene said she and Mayer knew little about how to run a business when they started.\n",
    "Greene has said that she became politically engaged during the 2016 Republican Party presidential primaries. In 2017, she began writing for the now defunct American Truth Seekers, a conspiracy news website, which published 59 articles by Greene. In January 2018, she started writing for Law Enforcement Today, a pro-police fake news website, which featured 27 articles Greene authored. In 2017, Greene visited Washington, D.C. to protest against a Republican gun control compromise.\n",

    "Having originally announced her intention to run in Georgia's 7th congressional district, Greene instead began her campaign in the 6th district, where she resided, on June 4, 2019. She stated her commitment to balance the federal budget and restrain Congress from using its constitutional power to spend more money, adding: \"If we look at our country as our household, we're going to go under foreclosure because we're overspending.\" Greene also criticized her expected primary opponent, former U.S. representative Karen Handel, for supporting large omnibus spending bills and a series of electoral losses: \"She's lost seven races in her entire political career... She steps down from seats that she does win so she can campaign for something else. Basically I would call her [a] professional campaigner, but she loses.\"\n",
    "On December 13, 2019, Greene announced that she was shifting her campaign to the 14th district after incumbent Tom Graves announced he would not run for reelection there. The district includes much of Northwest Georgia, stretching from the Georgia side of the Chattanooga metropolitan area to the exurbs of Atlanta. Members of the House are constitutionally required to live in the state they represent, but not necessarily in the same congressional district. Hence, although Greene had lived for a long time in Milton, in the 6th district, there would have been no legal barrier to Greene running for the 14th. Still, she said she intended to move to the 14th if she ran there\n"

She wrote that it was time for \"strong conservative Christians to go on the offense against these socialists who want to rip our country apart\"; the caption under the images was \"Squad's worst nightmare\". Nancy Pelosi called the meme a threat of violence, and Omar demanded that it be deleted after claiming it had triggered death threats. In response to questions from Forbes about whether the meme was a threat, a Greene campaign spokesperson dismissed that idea. Facebook deleted the meme the next day for violating its policies on inciting violence, prompting Greene to claim that Democrats were trying to \"cancel\" her.

In videos apparently recorded between 2017 and 2019, Greene said that abortion and Planned Parenthood are two factors holding back minorities in the country, and in an August 2020 interview with Fox News, she indicated her support for defunding Planned Parenthood. On April 15, 2021, Greene and Boebert cast two lone votes against a bill to reauthorize the National Marrow Donor Program. Explaining her vote, Greene falsely claimed: \"Nothing in this bill prevents the funding of aborted fetal tissue by taxpayers.\" In 2021, Greene falsely claimed that the Plan B contraceptive \"kills a baby in the womb\"; Plan B actually prevents ovulation and thus prevents pregnancy, instead of terminating a pregnancy.\n"

    "In September 2020, Greene wrote on Twitter that \"children should not wear masks\", calling recommendations by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other public health officials \"unhealthy for their psychological, emotional, and educational growth\" and \"emasculating\" for boys. She called restrictions imposed in the U.S. Capitol in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, including face mask requirements, \"tyrannical control\" by Democrats. She opposed any form of mandatory mask-wearing, compulsory vaccination, or lockdowns in response to the pandemic. After Greene called masks \"oppressive\", National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) director Anthony Fauci responded that her stance was \"very disturbing\" given the data on the seriousness of the outbreak. Greene and other Republicans refused to wear masks in a secured room with other members of Congress during the storming of the Capitol in January 2021; afterward, it was reported that several representatives tested positive for the virus, including Bonnie Watson Coleman, Pramila Jayapal, and Brad Schneider.\n",

    ". By March 2021, the private sector had begun efforts to create vaccine passports to better enable those who had been inoculated to resume public gatherings, and some states and the federal government were considering such plans, though the Biden administration said participation would not be compulsory. On Facebook and Twitter, Greene suggested the plan might be \"Biden's mark of the beast\", a reference to the Book of Revelation, echoing a far-right conspiracy theory that getting vaccinated is equivalent to pledging allegiance to the devil. She added: \"It's still fascism, or communism, whatever you want to call it, but it's coming from private companies. So, I have a term for that. I call it 'corporate communism.'\" Days later, Greene introduced a bill in the House, the We Will Not Comply Bill, which sought to ban vaccine passports, as well as the Fire Fauci Bill, which would eliminate Fauci's salary until his successor was confirmed by the Senate, although Senate confirmation is not required for Fauci's position as NIAID director. According to August 2021 financial disclosures, in 2020 Greene owned stocks in three COVID-19 vaccine manufacturers, with at least $15,000 of stock in both Pfizer and Johnson & Johnson, and at least $1,000 of stock in AstraZeneca.\n",

Two days later, on a podcast hosted by evangelical commentator David Brody, Greene called Pelosi \"mentally ill\" and said that Pelosi's requirement that House members continue wearing masks until they all prove they have been vaccinated \"is exactly the [same] type of abuse\" as Jews being \"put in trains and taken to gas chambers in Nazi Germany\" during the Holocaust. Greene said she incurred a second fine of $2,500 after she again entered the House floor without a mask, and she dubbed Pelosi \"Speaker Maskhole\" in response. The day after the podcast, she defended her comments, adding, \"any rational Jewish person doesn't like what's happening with overbearing mask mandates and overbearing vaccine policies.\" Her comments drew widespread criticism, including from leading Republican representatives and the Jewish community. On June 14, Greene publicly apologized for her comments after a private visit to the Holocaust Museum in Washington, D.C. Three weeks later, she compared Biden's suggestion to provide door-to-door vaccinations to \"medical brownshirts\" and said: \"You can't force people to be part of the human experiment.\" By the end of October 2021, she had been fined 20 times for not wearing a mask on the House floor.

During the Russian invasion of Ukraine, she criticized the \"corrupt\" Ukrainian government and argued against supplying Ukraine with weapons. She has suggested that Ukraine instigated the invasion by agitating Russia. In 2024, Greene proposed an amendment to a House foreign aid bill on Ukraine that would require all members of the House voting in favor of the bill to enlist in the Ukrainian military. Former Republican congressman Ken Buck has called Greene \"Moscow Marjorie\", due to her \"getting her talking points from the Kremlin\".

During the Iran–Israel War, Greene expressed skepticism that Iran was developing nuclear weapons, saying \"We've been told that for the past 20 years\", and stating that \"Americans don't want to bomb Iran\" for \"the secular government of Israel.\" After the American strikes on Iranian nuclear sites, Greene stated that \"this is not our fight\" and criticized their rationale, noting that \"there would not be bombs falling on the people of Israel if Netanyahu had not dropped bombs on the people of Iran first.\" Greene supported efforts to cut military funding for Israeli's missile defense system, stating, \"Israel bombed the Catholic Church in Gaza, and that entire population is being wiped out as they continue their aggressive war in Gaza\".\n",

After floor debate on the bill that day, Representative Marie Newman, whose congressional office is directly across from Greene's, displayed a transgender pride flag outside her office. In response, Greene displayed a transphobic poster outside her office reading: \"There are TWO genders: Male & Female. Trust The Science!\"\n"

She ended one of her videos commenting: \"The most mistreated group of people in the United States today are white males.\" After the murder of George Floyd, Greene posted on Facebook that his death \"must be investigated and justice will be served\", calling the video \"heartbreaking\". One year later, when Derek Chauvin was found guilty of Floyd's murder, Greene said the verdict was a result of jury intimidation by Black Lives Matter – which she compared to the Ku Klux Klan and called \"the most powerful domestic terrorist organization\" in the United States – and falsely asserted that Washington, D.C. was \"completely dead\" on the night of the verdict because people were \"scared to go out\" for \"fear of riots\". Greene denounced the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act, a civil rights and police reform bill, as an \"Anti-Police bill\", erroneously claiming it would bar law enforcement from using facial recognition.\n",
    "In a recording obtained by Politico, Greene said that Muslims who believe in Sharia law should not be in the U.S. government. She also contended that the Democratic Party is holding Black Americans as \"slaves\"\n"

This Earth warming, and carbon, is actually healthy for us. It helps us to feed people, it keeps people alive. ...

Greene made the video to promote a petition she started on We the People to impeach Pelosi for treason — a remedy that does not exist in the U.S. Constitution — due to her opposition to Trump's proposed border wall, as well as alleged support for sanctuary city policies. More than 140,000 people signed the petition. In February 2019 videos live-streamed on Facebook, Greene visited Pelosi's office and suggested that Pelosi would either be killed or imprisoned for treason. She then suggested that Representative Maxine Waters had also committed treason.\n",

For example, in response to an April 2018 post asking, \"Now do we get to hang them?? Meaning H & O???\", Greene's account responded: \"Stage is being set. Players are being put in place. We must be patient. This must be done perfectly or liberal judges would let them off.\" Greene did not deny the authenticity of the reported content, but stated that the CNN article was \"focused on my time before running for political office\", that \"teams of people manage my pages\", and that CNN had reported on content that \"did not represent my views\".\n"

    "In a 2018 Facebook post found by Media Matters in January 2021, Greene claimed that the 2018 Stoneman Douglas High School shooting in Parkland, Florida, was an organized false flag operation. In another post, she claimed that the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting was also a false flag operation. In another Facebook post later in 2018 she wrote: \"I am told that Nancy Pelosi tells Hillary Clinton several times a month that 'we need another school shooting' in order to persuade the public to want strict gun control.\" Parkland shooting survivors such as David Hogg and Cameron Kasky, as well as Fred Guttenberg, whose daughter was killed in the Parkland shooting, condemned Greene's remarks and demanded that she resign from Congress. Greene called Hogg, who advocates gun control, \"#littleHitler\" and, in a 2019 interview with a gun-rights group, denounced him as an \"idiot\" who is trained \"like a dog\". A March 2019 video shows Greene following and taunting Hogg, accusing him of using children for his cause. After the encounter, she called him a \"coward\" and falsely claimed he is funded by George Soros. The website Snopes found the video uploaded by Guttenberg and others was the second incident in which Greene targeted Hogg. Both occurred on March 25, 2019, and Greene live-streamed the first to her Facebook account\n"

In sharing the video, Greene wrote that: \"This is what the UN wants all over the world\".

On February 1, 2021, House majority leader Steny Hoyer gave McCarthy and other Republican House leaders an ultimatum: unless they stripped Greene of her committee seats within 72 hours, the Democrats would bring Wasserman Schultz's motion before the full House. In turn, McCarthy called some of Greene's comments \"deeply disturbing\".\n",
    "With Republican officials under mounting pressure to denounce Greene, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell issued a statement to The Hill in which he attacked \"loony lies and conspiracy theories\" as a \"cancer for the Republican Party\". The statement did not name Greene, but reporting described the statement as \"unmistakably about\" and \"clearly targeted\" at Greene. McConnell confirmed it the following day, referring to his comments on Greene and adding: \"I think I adequately spoke out about how I feel\"\n"

His statement said: \"Somebody who's suggested that perhaps no airplane hit the Pentagon on 9/11, that horrifying school shootings were pre-staged, and that the Clintons crashed JFK Jr.'s airplane is not living in reality.\" In response, Greene tweeted that the Republican Party's only problem are \"weak Republicans who only know how to lose gracefully\". After McConnell's statement, several other Republican senators voiced criticisms of Greene. Mitt Romney said that the Republican Party's \"big tent is not large enough to both accommodate conservatives and kooks\". Kevin Cramer said that he would have \"a hard time supporting ... [Greene] being on the Education Committee\" in the light of \"her positions on the school shootings being staged\", adding: \"Real authority has moral authority.\" Both Florida senators condemned the idea that the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting might have not have been real; Marco Rubio said that anyone arguing it was a false flag is \"either deranged or a sadist\". Greene used the criticism for a fundraising push, saying, \"Democrats are trying to expel me from Congress\" and telling her supporters to \"StandWithMTG\".\n",

In lieu of total removal from her assignments, McCarthy stated that he had suggested Greene be moved to the Small Business Committee. That day, the Democratic-controlled House Rules Committee passed Wasserman Schultz's motion to remove Greene from her committee assignments. McCarthy indicated his conference would not act against Greene. Pelosi chastised McCarthy for acquiescing to Greene, referring to him as \"McCarthy (Q-CA)\", in reference to the QAnon conspiracy theory. On February 4, the full House voted to remove Greene from her committee assignments. The vote was 230 to 199, with 11 Republicans joining all the Democrats. After the vote, Greene described herself as \"freed\", calling the committees part of \"basically a tyrannically controlled government\".\n"

    "In early 2022, Greene said that under a provision of a state law, several Georgia electors had filed papers seeking to remove her from the 2022 Republican primary ballot as unqualified for office. Electors alleged she had been involved in assisting the 2021 United States Capitol attack. On April 1, 2022, Greene filed a federal lawsuit in which she vigorously denied the allegations and sought to have the law blocked as unconstitutional. The law allows a candidate to be removed from a ballot after review by an administrative law judge and the Georgia Secretary of State. A federal judge denied her challenge on April 18, requiring her to give evidence four days later. She testified for three hours on April 22. On May 6, the judge ruled that she was eligible for reelection, but the final decision belongs to Georgia secretary of state Brad Raffensperger.\n"

After Greene opposed the Equality Act, her character featured again in February on the Weekend Update sketch, wherein she misspelled \"science\", compared herself to Pennywise the Dancing Clown, pulled a handgun on co-anchor Colin Jost, and claimed to be possessed by a demon. In June 2021, The Late Show with Stephen Colbert played a satirical, conspiracy-themed calendar song mocking Greene after she requested Biden reply to a letter she sent \"by June 31\", a date which does not exist.\n",
    "On June 15, 2021, after Greene's visit to the Holocaust Museum, Jimmy Kimmel Live! host Jimmy Kimmel called Greene \"human excrement\", \"Klan Mom\", and \"the sorriest excuse for a congresswoman we've ever had\", comparing her understanding of the Holocaust to that of a sixth-grader and digitally imposing a toothbrush mustache over her apology video. Daily Show host Trevor Noah called her \"your crazy aunt's even crazier friend\" who has become \"notorious for saying absolutely anything with zero shame\"\n"

    "On February 9, 2022, while discussing the police guarding the Capitol building, Greene, using a malapropism, called them \"gazpacho police\", confusing the cold Spanish soup with the Gestapo. The incident met with a wave of jokes about her confusion. A similar incident occurred in May 2022, with Greene calling a Petri dish a \"peach tree dish\" during a livestream.\n",
    "In April 2022, Kimmel said of Greene, \"Where is Will Smith when you really need him?\" in response to Greene accusing Republicans who supported then-Supreme Court nominee Ketanji Brown Jackson of being \"pro-pedophile\", referencing the incident in which Smith slapped comedian Chris Rock at the Academy Awards. Greene accused Kimmel of threatening violence against her and tweeted that she contacted the Capitol Police. Greene had previously refused to honor the Capitol Police in June 2021, when she voted against rewarding them with the Congressional Gold Medal for defending the Capitol Building during the 2021 United States Capitol attack. On April 8, Nick Dyer, Greene's spokesman, said that \"threats against Congresswoman Greene invoking Jimmy Kimmel have been coming into our office.\"\n",

In 2023, Greene began dating Brian Glenn, the director of programming for the Right Side Broadcasting Network.\n",
    "Greene was baptized, raised, and married as a member of the Roman Catholic Church, but stopped attending Catholic Mass in reaction to the child sexual abuse crisis in the church. She was rebaptized in 2011 into North Point Community Church, an evangelical megachurch network based in Alpharetta, in a baptism published in an online video. She speaks often about her faith and has said that she wants to bring \"my faith and my family values to Washington\".\n",
    "According to ABC affiliate WSB-TV in Atlanta, in May 2021, Greene broke Georgia law by claiming homestead exemptions on two properties. One of the properties is an older home, and the other is a property that she purchased in Georgia's 14th congressional district when she ran for office. Only one exemption may legally be claimed. Greene responded that the issue was \"paperwork, which is being taken care of\".\n",
    "Greene participated in the CrossFit quarterfinals for the 2014, 2015 and 2018 CrossFit Games.\n",
