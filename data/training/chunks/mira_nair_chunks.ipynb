    "Mira Nair's 1991 film Mississippi Masala earned $7.3 million, won Best Original Screenplay at Venice, and led her to meet her future husband, political scientist Mahmood Mamdani. Her biggest breakthrough came with Monsoon Wedding, made for about $1.5 million and ultimately grossing over $30 million worldwide; its $13.9 million U.S. gross set a North American record for an Indian film until 2017, and it won her the Golden Lion—the first for a woman director. Celebrated by critics like Roger Ebert, the film cemented Nair's reputation for crossing cultural boundaries.

    "Mira Nair was born on 15 October 1957, in Rourkela, Orissa (now Odisha), India, the youngest of three children, and the only girl.\n",
    "Her father, Amrit Lal Nair, was an officer of the Indian Administrative Service, and her mother, Praveen Nair, was a social worker.  Her family is of Punjabi origin with roots in Delhi, and is Hindu. The family name \"Nayyar\" was changed by her grandfather, although one of her uncles continues to use it.\n",
    "Nair grew up in a \"colonial-style bungalow, with [a] spacious veranda and terracotta-tiled floor\". Her father, Amrit, was a remote character, who was \"not much fun\", and her parents later (around 1990) separated, after years of tension and fighting. Nair appreciated Amrit's love of Persian poetry and song, but he drove his children hard, insisting that they \"spend their time usefully\". He also argued with her brothers, Vikram and Gautam, a lot, but being a girl, Mira was regarded as less important, and was allowed to just get on with doing what interested her. Praveen had a strong influence on the young Mira, particularly her independence, confidence, fearlessness, and social awareness\n"

    "In a 2004 interview with FF2 Media's Jan Huttner, Nair commented on her filmmaking process:It's all in how I do it. Keeping the bums on the seats is very important to me. It requires that ineffable thing called rhythm and balance in movie-making. Foils have to be created, counter-weights. From the intimacy, let's say, of a love scene to the visceral, jugular quality of war. That shift is something in the editing, how one cuts from the intimate to the epic that keeps you there waiting. The energy propels you.\n",
    "In an interview with Image Journal in 2017, Nair said that she had chosen directing over any other art form because it was collaborative. She said, \"That's why I am neither a photographer nor writer, I like to work with people, and my strength, if any, is that. Working with life.\"\n"

    "In her early years, Nair primarily made documentaries in which she explored Indian cultural traditions. For her film thesis at Harvard, between 1978 and 1979, she produced a black-and-white film titled Jama Masjid Street Journal. In the 18-minute film, Nair explored the streets of Old Delhi and had casual conversations with Indian locals, using a Bolex camera. The film's name derives from a Muslim community near the Jama Masjid, a large mosque in Old Delhi.\n",
    "After Nair graduated and moved to New York, American filmmaker D. A. Pennebaker, a pioneer of the cinéma vérité style of documentary filmmaking, liked Jama Masjid Street Journal and helped Nair secure a grant for her next film. Her second documentary, So Far from India (1982), was a 52-minute film that follows an Indian newspaper dealer living in the subways of New York. His pregnant wife waits for him to return home to India. The protagonist, Ashok, slowly becomes estranged from not only his family, but also his Indian heritage. Nair directed So Far from India as a commentary on the life of an immigrant separated from his home and suffering cultural isolation. The film won Best Documentary at the American Film Festival in Wrocław, Poland and New York's Global Village Film Festival.\n",
    "Her third documentary, India Cabaret, with cinematography by her husband Mitch Epstein, opened the inaugural Indian International Film Festival, in Hyderabad, in 1985. The film was very well received at the festival\n"

    ". It portrays the exploitation of female strippers in Bombay, and follows a customer who regularly visits a local strip club while his wife stays at home. Nair raised roughly $130,000 for the project. The 59-minute film was shot over a span of two months. India Cabaret was widely criticized, primarily by Indian men,  who objected to the portrayal of women working as strippers or those who are forced to marry. In New York some opponents tried to block release of the film on WNET. The film was bought by PBS, but then rejected by Channel 13, the network's New York affiliate. Nair's family, especially her father, also criticized it. He said she should not have positively portrayed these women. Nair created India Cabaret to reveal the prejudice shown towards sex workers. Some feminists criticized her for filming these women through the male gaze, due to the sexual nature of the strip clubs. The film received several awards, including the Blue Ribbon award and two awards for Best Documentary.\n",
    "Children of a Desired Sex (1987) was the fourth documentary Nair directed. Made for Canadian television, this film explored how amniocentesis was being used to determine the sex of fetuses.

    "In June 1987, with Taraporevala, Nair researched and co-wrote Salaam Bombay!, which turned out to be an enormous and exhausting undertaking. Nair sought out real street children to more authentically portray the lives of children who survived in the streets and were deprived of a true childhood. Mitch Epstein was co-producer and production designer on the film. They struggled to get financing, but eventually Nair \"managed to cajole completion cash out of a French company\". On 19 May 1988, three days after Nair had finished cutting the film, it had its world première at the closing gala at the 1988 Cannes Film Festival. It earned a 15-minute standing ovation, and won the Caméra d'Or (the first Indian film to do so) and the Prix du public (Audience Prize). It was nominated at the 1989 Academy Awards for Best Foreign Language Film. Although it did not do well at the box office, it won 23 international awards.\n",
    "Nair and Taraporevala next worked together on the 1991 film Mississippi Masala, which told the story of Ugandan-born Indians (displaced by Idi Amin in 1972) in Mississippi. Their research for the film started in March 1989, and was their first visit to Africa.  Nair met her second husband, Asian Ugandan academic Mahmood Mamdani, when she interviewed him in Nairobi after having read his book From Citizen to Refugee, about the expulsion of Asians\n"

    ". The film centers on a carpet-cleaner business owner (Denzel Washington) who falls in love with the daughter (Sarita Choudhury) of one of his Indian clients. The film revealed the prejudice in black and Indian communities. Mississippi Masala was heavily inspired by the history of Indian emigrants in Uganda. Nair was inspired by the fact that Ugandan-born Indians often aligned themselves more with white people, especially due to the worse treatment Black Ugandans endured. It was well received by critics, earned a standing ovation at the 1992 Sundance Film Festival, and won three awards at the Venice Film Festival.\n",
    "Her next feature, The Perez Family (1995) was not a success. The producer said that it had \"too much plot\", and a critic wrote, \"It looks like a musical after all the songs have been cut out.\" The next one, Kama Sutra: A Tale of Love (1996), which Nair later called \"an aberration\", also bombed. In that year, the family moved to South Africa for three years, where her career \"stagnated\".\n",
    "Monsoon Wedding, written by Sabrina Dhawan, was filmed over only 30 days, using only a small crew, including some of Nair's acquaintances and relatives. Released in 2001, the film told the story of an Indian Punjabi wedding. In the end, the film grossed over $30 million worldwide. The film was awarded the Golden Lion award at the Venice Film Festival, making Nair the first female recipient of the award.\n",

    "In 1977, Nair met her first husband, photographer Mitch Epstein, when taking photography classes at Harvard University. He was her lecturer, and they married in 1981 in India, in a traditional Punjabi wedding, despite Epstein being \"a Jewish boy from Holyoke, Massachusetts.\" They were together for 12 years, of which they were married for 8. They divorced around 1989.\n",
    "On 29 March 1989, Nair met her second husband, Indo-Ugandan political scientist Mahmood Mamdani, in Nairobi, Kenya, while doing research for the film Mississippi Masala. She had read his book From Citizen to Refugee, about the expulsion of Asians. Nair moved in with Mamdani on campus at Makerere University, where he was teaching.  They married in 1991, and their son, Zohran Mamdani, was born in Kampala, Uganda, in the same year. In 1996 the family moved to Cape Town, South Africa, for Mahmood to take up an appointment as head of the African studies program at the University of Cape Town, where they lived for around three years.\n",
    "In 2020, her son, Zohran Mamdani, won a seat representing Astoria, Queens, in the New York State Assembly. He became the mayor-elect of New York City on 5 November 2025.\n",
    "She has two older brothers, Vikram and Gautam.\n",
    "Nair has been an enthusiastic yoga practitioner for decades; when making a film, she has the cast and crew start the day with a yoga session.\n"

In posts on Twitter, Nair wrote: \"I will go to Israel when the walls come down. I will go to Israel when occupation is gone...I will go to Israel when the state does not privilege one religion over another. I will go to Israel when Apartheid is over. I stand w/ Palestine for the Academic and Cultural Boycott of Israel (PACBI) & the larger BDS Mov't.\" Nair was praised by PACBI, which said her decision to boycott Israel \"helps to highlight the struggle against colonialism and apartheid.\"\n"
