    "In 1998, Jeffrey Manchester is a divorced U.S. Army veteran living in North Carolina. Struggling to provide for his three young children, Jeffrey is reminded by Steve, his friend and fellow member of the 82nd Airborne Division, of his powerful skills of observation. Jeffrey uses his knack for noticing and exploiting routines to rob a McDonald's fast food restaurant, breaking in through the roof at night. Surprising the morning shift, Jeffrey orders the employees into the walk-in freezer but treats them kindly, even handing over his own coat to the manager to wear before escaping with the contents of the safe.\n",
    "Over the next two years, Jeffrey uses the same strategy over 40 times, capturing the attention of the authorities and the media as the mysterious \"Roofman\". Arrested at his daughter's birthday party after attempting to flee, he is sentenced to 45 years in prison while his ex-wife Talana ends his contact with their children. \n",
    "Using his ingenuity, he escapes prison. He conceals himself inside a store, subsisting on a lot of candy and observing the employees. \n",
    "As a fugitive, he has limited options for living arrangements, but he begins a relationship with one of the unsuspecting employees, Leigh. \n",
    "Stealing toys to donate to the toy drive Leigh has organized at her church, Jeffrey claims to be John, a visiting New Yorker\n"
