    "An election for the mayor of New York City was held on November 2, 2021. Incumbent mayor Bill de Blasio was term-limited and ineligible to run for re-election. Democratic Brooklyn Borough president and former police officer Eric Adams won the election in a landslide, defeating Republican candidate Curtis Sliwa. Adams became the city's second Black mayor.\n",
    "Primary elections took place on June 22, 2021. Rather than the plurality voting of previous primaries, the elections were the first to use ranked-choice voting. Sliwa, founder of Guardian Angels, handily won the Republican primary over New York State Federation of Taxi Drivers founder Fernando Mateo. Polling showed businessman Andrew Yang as the frontrunner as of May 2021, but his lead later shrank as Adams emerged and eventually won in the final round of the Democratic primary over former New York City Department of Sanitation Commissioner Kathryn Garcia.\n",
    "In the general election, Adams maintained a sizable lead over Sliwa and was heavily favored to win. On election day, Adams won easily, receiving 66.99% of the vote to Sliwa's 27.76%. He was sworn in on January 1, 2022.\n"

    "In the 2017 mayoral election, lncumbent Bill de Blasio was re-elected mayor of New York City for a second term, defeating Republican nominee Nicole Malliotakis. New York City used proportional representation (single transferable voting) from 1937 to 1947. Such a system produced benefits to voters and elected a more diverse city council than had been produced under first-past-the-post voting before and after.\n",
    "In 2019, New York City voters passed Ballot Question #1 to amend the City Charter to \"give voters the choice of ranking up to five candidates in primary and special elections for mayor, public advocate, comptroller, borough president, and city council beginning in January 2021\". The first election in the city to use ranked-choice voting (Instant-runoff voting) was in the 24th council district in Queens, which took place on February 2, 2021. This was the first time ranked-choice voting was used in the New York City mayoral election.\n",
    "In 2019, journalists and political commentators predicted several potential 2021 mayoral candidates, including Brooklyn Borough President Eric Adams, Bronx Borough President Rubén Díaz Jr., NYC Council Speaker Corey Johnson, NYC Comptroller Scott Stringer, and NYC Public Advocate Jumaane Williams.\n",
    "By May 2021, thirteen candidates had qualified for the Democratic Party primary, and two for the Republican Party primary. There are also minor party and independent campaigns for the general election in November.\n"

    "Polling in late January and early February 2021 showed businessman Andrew Yang as the Democratic primary frontrunner, with Adams in second place and Stringer in third place. \n",
    "In April, Scott Stringer was accused of sexual abuse by Jean Kim. Stringer denied the allegations, claiming that the relationship had been consensual. In June, a second woman accused him of sexual misconduct.\n",
    "On May 5, 2021, Politico reported that a recent poll found that Eric Adams was leading the Democratic primary contest; this marked the first time since January that any Democratic candidate other than Yang had led in a public poll. On June 7, Spectrum News reported that Adams had maintained a lead in the Democratic primary.\n",
    "On July 6, the Associated Press reported that Adams had won the Democratic primary. The Guardian stated that Adams, a \"former police captain\", had prevailed \"after appealing to the political center and promising to strike the right balance between fighting crime and ending racial injustice in policing\". An earlier report from The New York Times asserted that Adams had run as a \"working-class underdog\" and had \"hammered away at the message that he was the only candidate who could tackle both crime and police reform\".\n"

This is partly attributed to Sliwa's pledge to halt the construction of homeless shelters which were proposed by Adams to be built in neighborhoods such as Asian-majority Sunset Park. Other issues of importance to Asian American activist leaders included proposed reforms to the Specialized High Schools Admissions Test in high schools, bail reform, and plans to build new jails in neighborhoods such as Chinatown, Manhattan.\n"
