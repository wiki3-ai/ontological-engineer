    "Muchhal released six non-filmi albums prior to her adulthood. In 2001, when she was nine, her first album \"Child For Children\" was released by Tips Music. In 2003, her second album Palken was released. In later years she released her other albums Aao Tumhe Chand Per Le Jaaye, Beti Hu Mahakal Ki, and Dil Ke Liye. In 2011, her Jai Jai Dev Ganesh album was released by T-Series. Muchhal moved to Mumbai from Indore in late 2006 to find opportunities in Bollywood for her singing career. She sang her first Bollywood song for the October 2011 movie Damadamm!, receiving generally positive reviews. She sang her second song, \"Pyaar Ke Silsile\", a month later for movie Na Jaane Kabse. The music in Na Jaane Kabse, and the movie also, received bad reviews. Muchhal was an acquaintance of actor Salman Khan. Khan had recommended her name earlier to music director Sajid–Wajid for his film Veer. Khan had also recommended her name to Yash Raj Banner. Following this, Muchhal dubbed the song \"Laapata\" with KK for Yash Raj banner which was included in 2012 blockbuster movie Ek Tha Tiger. The song was filmed on Salman Khan and Katrina Kaif. The song was a hit and introduced her to Bollywood.\n"

    "Muchhal became a member of Kalyanji–Anandji Little Star, a group of young singers, when she was four years old. During the Kargil War of 1999, when aged seven, she spent a week singing at shops in her home city, Indore, to raise funds for the families of deceased Indian soldiers. Her efforts received substantial coverage in Indian media and she raised ₹25,000 (US$810). Later that year, she sang to raise funds for victims of the 1999 Odisha cyclone.\n",
    "Her decision to use her voice to help others was triggered when she saw poor children using their clothes to clean train compartments. Around the same time, teachers at Nidhi Bal Vinay Mandir, an Indore-based school, approached Muchhal and her parents with a request for a charity show to raise funds for their pupil, Lokesh, who was suffering from a congenital heart defect. Lokesh's father was an impoverished footwear shop-owner and was unable to afford the high cost of heart surgery. Muchhal and her parents agreed to arrange a show and in March 2000, she used a street vendor's cart as a stage for the event and collected ₹51,000 (US$1,600) towards the cost of surgery. The attendant publicity prompted Bangalore-based cardiologist, Devi Prasad Shetty, to operate on Lokesh free of charge. Muchhal's parents  advertised in local newspapers to promote donations toward heart surgery for children like Lokesh\n"

In 2006 Muchhal was one of the five heroic stories broadcast by Star Gold channel as part of its \"Rang De Basanti Salaam\" (Salute to Color of Sacrifice) initiative. By June 2009 Muchhal had staged 1,460 charity shows across the world, which had raised ₹1.71 crore (US$200,000) for Palak Muchhal Heart Foundation. These funds helped to save the lives of 338 children.\n",
