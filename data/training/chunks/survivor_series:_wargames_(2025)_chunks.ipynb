    "The 2025 Survivor Series: WarGames, also promoted as Survivor Series: WarGames San Diego, was a professional wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) and livestreaming event produced by WWE. It was the 39th annual Survivor Series and took place on Saturday, November 29, 2025, at Petco Park in San Diego, California, held for wrestlers from the promotion's Raw and SmackDown brand divisions. This was the fourth annual Survivor Series based around the WarGames match, a team-based steel cage match where the roofless cage surrounds two rings placed side by side.\n",
    "This was the first Survivor Series to take place in an outdoor venue, the first to take place in a stadium, the first to be held in a Major League Baseball venue, and the second to be held in the U.S. state of California, after the 2018 event in Los Angeles. It featured the first WarGames match to take place inside a stadium since July 1988, which was held by the former World Championship Wrestling (WCW). This was also the first Survivor Series to broadcast on Netflix internationally and on ESPN's direct-to-consumer streaming service in the United States. The event also featured John Cena's last appearance at both Survivor Series and on PPV as an in-ring performer due to his retirement from professional wrestling at the end of 2025.\n",
    "Four matches were contested at the event, including two WarGames matches that each involved wrestlers from both brands\n"

    "Survivor Series is an annual professional wrestling event produced every November by WWE since 1987, generally held the week of Thanksgiving. The second longest running pay-per-view (PPV) event in history (behind WWE's WrestleMania), it is one of the promotion's five biggest events of the year, along with WrestleMania, SummerSlam, Royal Rumble, and Money in the Bank, referred to as the \"Big Five\". From 1987 to 2021, the event was characterized by having Survivor Series matches, which were tag team elimination matches that typically featured teams of four or five wrestlers against each other. In 2022, the event was rebranded as \"Survivor Series: WarGames\" and instead of Survivor Series matches, the annual event became based around the WarGames match, a type of steel cage match where two teams face each other in a roofless cage that surrounds two rings placed side by side and the teams typically feature four to five wrestlers each but is decided by one fall instead of eliminating all opponents. WWE's developmental brand NXT previously held an annual WarGames event from 2017 to 2021 before the match became a part of Survivor Series.\n",
    "Announced on April 21, 2025, the 39th Survivor Series was scheduled for Saturday, November 29, 2025, at Petco Park in San Diego, California. It was the first Survivor Series event to be held in an outside venue and the first to be held in a stadium, and it was held for wrestlers from the promotion's Raw and SmackDown brand divisions\n"

    "For most of 2025, CM Punk, Roman Reigns, and Jey Uso were involved in a rivalry against The Vision (Seth Rollins, Bron Breakker, Bronson Reed, and Paul Heyman). At Night 1 of SummerSlam, Reigns and Jey defeated Breakker and Reed in a tag team match, while Punk won the World Heavyweight Championship, however, Rollins immediately cashed in his Money in the Bank contract on Punk to win the title. Also at Night 1 of SummerSlam, Drew McIntyre and Logan Paul, who formed an alliance a month before, won a tag team match. Both Jey and Punk subsequently failed to win the title from Rollins in a fatal four-way match at Clash in Paris, whilst at the same event, Reigns defeated Reed only to be viciously attacked post-match by Reed and Breakker. At Wrestlepalooza, Jey teamed up with his twin brother Jimmy Uso to face Breakker and Reed in a tag team match, where Reed and Breakker won, Punk defeated Rollins in a mixed tag team match, and Undisputed WWE Champion Cody Rhodes defeated McIntyre to retain his title. At Crown Jewel, Reed defeated Reigns in an Australian Street Fight, after which, Rollins faced longtime rival Rhodes for the WWE Crown Jewel Championship, where Rollins won after he struck Rhodes with a Rolex watch. Two nights later on Raw, Breakker, Reed, and Heyman turned on Rollins, exiling him from the group\n"

As a result of the attack, Rollins was forced to vacate the title, with Punk defeating Jey at Saturday Night's Main Event XLI to win the vacant title, while the same night, Rhodes retained the title once again against McIntyre. Two nights later on Raw during Punk's celebration, he was interrupted by Paul, who wanted a title shot. They were both interrupted by The Vision, with Heyman stating that The Vision were next in line for the title. This led to a brawl where The Vision stood tall against Paul and Punk. Later that same night, Jey and Punk faced The Vision in a tag team match, which ended in a double countout. After that, Paul appeared and attacked Punk with brass knuckles, joining forces with The Vision. On the November 7 episode of SmackDown, McIntyre was suspended by SmackDown General Manager Nick Aldis after attacking Rhodes and a referee. On the November 10 episode of Raw, Paul and The Vision interrupted Punk, and went to attack him. However, Jey and Rhodes joined Punk, leading to another brawl. After that, Punk challenged Heyman to find a team for a WarGames match against him, Rhodes, and Jey, which Raw General Manager Adam Pearce agreed. On that week's SmackDown, Jimmy announced that, after speaking with Punk, he would be the fourth member of Punk's team. Later that night, Reed faced Rhodes for the title, which ended in a disqualification win for Rhodes after Breakker and Paul interfered\n"

Also that same night, Asuka and Sane appeared dressed as doctors, with Asuka spitting Green Mist on Bliss and Flair. Three nights later on Raw, The Kabuki Warriors defeated Bliss and Flair to win the title after interference from Jax and Legend. After that, the four women attacked Flair and Bliss, who were saved by the returning Sky and Ripley. After that, Ripley challenged The Kabuki Warriors, Legend, and Jax for a WarGames match, which was subsequently made official. However, on that week's SmackDown, Flair announced that she would not be in the match due to past issues with Ripley. Three days later on Raw, Lee made her return, distracting Lynch, costing her the WWE Women's Intercontinental Championship. On that week's SmackDown, Flair and Ripley decided to leave their problems aside, and later that night, Ripley announced Lee as their fifth team member. However, during a brawl between both teams, Lynch attacked Lee during her entrance. Lynch subsequently joined Kabuki Warriors, Legend, and Jax as their fifth team member. The following week on SmackDown, Flair defeated Asuka to earn the WarGames advantage.\n"

As shark cages were not used, each wrestler entered at different intervals. Flair and Asuka began the match. The next person to enter was Sky wielding a garbage can lid. Lynch entered next with a kendo stick and immediately attacked Sky. Bliss then entered next. Sane then entered the match, briefly taking control with a metal chain, followed by Lee, who scaled the cage to enter after Lynch closed the cage door to prevent Lee from entering. Jax entered and overpowered several wrestlers. Ripley entered next with a trash can and kendo sticks and cleared the ring. The last to enter was Legend, officially starting the match. Legend dominated various wrestlers. Legend performed a punt kick on Ripley for a nearfall. Lynch performed a Man Handle Slam on Lee, however, Sky performed a moonsault on Lynch to void the pin attempt. Ripley was surrounded by the opposing team and Flair saved Ripley by pushing Ripley aside which led to Asuka accidentally spraying mist onto Legend. Lee, with assurance from Ripley, handed Sky a trash can, who was perched atop the cage. Sky placed herself in the trash can and performed a senton from the top of the cage onto the other opposing team members, besides Lynch who was standing from afar and left alone\n"

Reed then entered the match, and hit multiple Tsunamis upon entering followed by Jey, who delivered superkicks and a 1-D with Jimmy to Paul. Lesnar entered with Paul Heyman, followed by Reigns, who delivered spears and brass-knuckle strikes to several opponents. A masked, unidentified wrestler appeared atop the cage and attacked Punk with a superkick and a curb stomp, enabling Breakker to hit a Spear to pin Punk for the victory. The winning team celebrated on the aisle as fireworks erupted. After the match, Reigns helped Punk to his feet and exchanged a fist bump with him, but told Rhodes that they would not be teaming together again before walking away.\n"
