    "Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba – The Movie: Infinity Castle (Japanese: 劇場版「鬼滅の刃」無限城編, Hepburn: Gekijō-ban Kimetsu no Yaiba: Mugen Jō-hen) is a 2025 Japanese animated dark fantasy action film based on the Infinity Castle arc of the 2016–20 manga series Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba by Koyoharu Gotouge. It is a direct sequel to the fourth season of the anime television series as well as the manga fourth, fifth, and sixth adaptations, following the film Mugen Train (2020) and the feature-length compilations To the Swordsmith Village (2023) and To the Hashira Training (2024). It is directed by Haruo Sotozaki, produced by Ufotable, and written by the studio's staff members. It follows the Demon Slayer Corps in their decisive climactic battle against Muzan Kibutsuji and the remaining Upper Ranks within the titular \"Infinity Castle\".\n",
    "Unlike the Swordsmith Village and Hashira Training adaptations, which are compilations of episodes from the anime series, Infinity Castle is a feature-length multi-film adaptation due to the arc's content and dramatic pacing, similarly to Mugen Train. It is the first film of a trilogy announced in June 2024, immediately following the airing of the fourth season's finale.\n",
    "It was released in Japan on July 18, 2025, by Aniplex and Toho. It was released by Crunchyroll through Sony Pictures Releasing in select Asian countries in August, before releasing in all other territories the following month\n"

He enters the Transparent World and Selfless State, giving him heightened perception and masking his emotions, successfully beheading Akaza.

After being caught stealing numerous times, his father committed suicide to unburden him, leading to a chance encounter with a dojo owner, Keizo. Hakuji served as his sole disciple while caring for his sick daughter, Koyuki\n"
