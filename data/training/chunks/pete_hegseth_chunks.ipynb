    "Peter Brian Hegseth (born June 6, 1980) is an American government official and former television personality who has served as the 29th United States secretary of defense since 2025.\n",
    "Hegseth studied politics at Princeton University, where he was the publisher of The Princeton Tory, a conservative student newspaper. In 2003, he was commissioned as an infantry officer in the Minnesota Army National Guard, serving at Guantanamo Bay Naval Base and deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan. Hegseth worked for several organizations after leaving Iraq, including as an executive director at Vets for Freedom and Concerned Veterans for America. He became a contributor to Fox News in 2014. Hegseth served as an advisor to President Donald Trump after supporting his campaign in 2016. From 2017 to 2024, Hegseth co-hosted Fox & Friends Weekend. He has written several books, including American Crusade (2020) and The War on Warriors (2024).\n",
    "In November 2024, President-elect Trump named Hegseth as his nominee for secretary of defense. In a Senate Committee on Armed Services hearing days before Trump's second inauguration, Hegseth faced allegations of sexual misconduct, financial mismanagement, and excessive drinking. Hegseth was confirmed by the Senate that month, with Vice President JD Vance casting a tie-breaking vote. It was only the second time in US history that a Cabinet nominee's confirmation was decided by a vice president (following Betsy DeVos during the first Trump administration in 2017)\n"

    "Peter Brian Hegseth was born on June 6, 1980, in Minneapolis, Minnesota. He is of Norwegian descent. He was the first child of Brian and Penelope \"Penny\" (Haugen) Hegseth. Hegseth's father was a basketball coach for high schools across Minnesota before retiring in 2019; his mother is an executive business coach who has taught with the Minnesota Excellence in Public Service (MEPS) Series, a fellowship and leadership program for Republican and center-right women. Hegseth was raised in Forest Lake, Minnesota, and attended Forest Lake Area High School. He graduated in 1999 as valedictorian. \n",
    "After high school, Hegseth enrolled at Princeton University, where he majored in Politics for his Artium Baccalaureus degree from the Ivy League school. According to Reserve & National Guard Magazine, he chose Princeton over an offer from the United States Military Academy to play for the school's basketball team. Months before the September 11 attacks, Hegseth joined the Reserve Officers' Training Corps. During his years at Princeton, Hegseth was publisher and editor-in-chief of The Princeton Tory, the school's conservative student newspaper. \n",
    "In April 2002, Hegseth declared that as publisher of The Princeton Tory, he would \"defend the pillars of Western civilization against the distractions of diversity\"\n"

He briefly worked as an equity-markets analyst at Bear Stearns. Hegseth completed his basic training at Fort Benning in Columbus, Georgia, in 2004, and for 11 months he was a Minnesota Army National Guardsman at Guantanamo Bay detention camp. There, he led a platoon of soldiers from the New Jersey Army National Guard guarding detainees. By July 2005, he had returned to Bear Stearns; shortly thereafter, he volunteered in the Iraq War as an infantry officer, where he received a Bronze Star Medal. Hegseth served in the 3rd Battalion, 187th Infantry Regiment in the 101st Airborne Division, led by Colonel Michael D. Steele. He began his tour in Baghdad before moving to Samarra, where he served as a civil affairs officer, working with the city council and forming an alliance with councilmember Asaad Ali Yaseen. Hegseth has described a near-death experience in Iraq in which a rocket-propelled grenade hit his vehicle but failed to detonate.\n"

By April, his campaign had raised US$160,000. Hegseth lost to Kurt Bills in the Republican convention in May, and withdrew his nomination days later. He founded MN PAC to support similar candidates, though a third of the organization's funds went to parties for personal friends and family. Hegseth began working as president of Concerned Veterans of America, a group funded by the Koch brothers, that year. The group criticized Obama for the 2014 Veterans Health Administration controversy. Hegseth enrolled in the Harvard Kennedy School in 2009, but completed just one semester; he graduated in 2013 with a degree in public policy. In 2022, to protest the offering of classes in critical race theory at Harvard University, he reportedly wrote \"Return to sender\" on his degree and sent it back to the university.\n",

Another former employee claimed he had witnessed Hegseth drunkenly chanting \"Kill all Muslims!\" In December, President-elect Donald Trump considered Hegseth for secretary of veterans affairs, but he faced opposition from veterans groups who viewed Hegseth's support for allowing all veterans to choose private doctors as untenable; Paul Rieckhoff, the executive director of Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, said that selecting Hegseth would \"be war\" and \"a radical departure\" for the department. Trump later chose David Shulkin, with The Washington Post noting Hegseth's lack of experience in operating a large organization. Hegseth told podcaster Shawn Ryan that Trump found him too young to assume the position. After Shulkin fell out of favor with the Trump administration in March 2018, Hegseth positioned himself as a potential candidate, but Trump selected Robert Wilkie after consulting Hegseth and financier Isaac Perlmutter.\n"

In 2016, he was briefly a host on TheBlaze before regularly hosting Fox & Friends Weekend that year after Ailes's resignation, becoming an official co-host in January 2017. According to a Fox News executive in Hoax (2020), Jennifer Rauchet, a producer of Fox & Friends Weekend who later married him, \"was favoring Pete with airtime\" and \"kept putting Pete on TV.\" Hegseth served as a temporary host for Laura Ingraham on The Ingraham Angle in an effort by the network to promote other staffers; the change occurred during the boycott of The Ingraham Angle after comments Ingraham made about David Hogg, an activist and survivor of the Parkland high school shooting. He hosted All-American New Year (2018) with commentator Lisa Kennedy.\n",
    "Hegseth's opinions expressed on Fox & Friends influenced Trump's policymaking in his first term. In October 2018, as a migrant caravan began traveling to the United States, Trump claimed that \"unknown Middle Easterners\" had infiltrated the caravan. Trump apparently cited a comment that Hegseth had made on Fox & Friends, though Hegseth said he had not verified his statement's accuracy. Hegseth had apparently based his claim on a statement Guatemalan president Jimmy Morales made after capturing 100 ISIS fighters in the country\n"

    "At Fox News, Hegseth was the subject of multiple lawsuits. In 2015, he threw an axe during a Flag Day event in New York City, accidentally hitting a drummer from the United States Military Academy. Video of the incident circulated widely online. The drummer, Jeff Prosperie, alleged that he had suffered \"severe and serious personal injuries to his mind and body\" and \"permanent effects of pain, disability, disfigurement and loss of body function.\" Prosperie sued Hegseth three years later; the suit was resolved in an unspecified way in 2019. In Dominion Voting Systems v. Fox News Network (2023), Dominion Voting Systems included a segment of Fox & Friends Weekend featuring Hegseth with co-hosts Will Cain and Rachel Campos-Duffy, in which they did not reject claims by Rudy Giuliani that the company's voting machines facilitated voting fraud.\n",
    "Hegseth was chosen among Fox News's hosts to be featured on Fox Nation, the network's streaming service. To promote the service, he co-hosted a one-hour special, Fox Nation First Look, with Jesse Watters, Tomi Lahren, Britt McHenry, and Tyrus. On Fox Nation, Hegseth hosted The Miseducation of America (2022–2023), a television program criticizing \"the Left's educational agenda\". He also hosted the series Battle in the Holy Land (2019–2023), The Life of Jesus (2022–2023), and the special Battle in Bethlehem (2019), on the service.\n"

Hegseth subsequently ended his contract with Fox News. The selection of Hegseth was seen as a sign that Trump sought to appoint a loyalist to lead the Department of Defense, and his relative lack of experience surprised officials in the department. According to Vanity Fair, Trump's transition team became aware the following day of a sexual assault allegation involving Hegseth that occurred in Monterey, California, seven years prior; The Washington Post reported that senior officials on the team were surprised by the allegation and reconsidered his nomination. Despite the allegation, Trump defended Hegseth and several Republican senators indicated that they would support him. His nomination was threatened by an article from Jane Mayer in The New Yorker detailing alleged financial mismanagement and alcohol issues while leading his veterans' groups, while an NBC News article reported that his drinking habits concerned his colleagues at Fox News; The New York Times reported in December that Trump had begun to consider Florida governor Ron DeSantis as an alternative.\n",

Advisors to Trump privately sought to persuade him to support Hegseth in fear that it would embolden recalcitrant Republican senators, while he could not garner support for DeSantis, according to The New York Times. In addition, the Times reported that Vice President-elect JD Vance had led a group of Republicans, including Donald Trump Jr., former Trump aide Steve Bannon, political activist Charlie Kirk, and Breitbart News reporter Matt Boyle. Trump allies took a direct approach to addressing the controversies, including an interview with Megyn Kelly that impressed Trump. Hegseth appeared at the United States Capitol; Trump publicly reaffirmed his support for Hegseth afterwards. The visit gave Iowa senator Joni Ernst, who had threatened his nomination, a positive impression of Hegseth.\n",

He positioned himself as a \"warrior\" while denying the allegations and his previous claims that women should not serve in combat roles. Hegseth was criticized by Democrats over allegations of sexual misconduct, financial mismanagement, and alcohol issues. Rhode Island senator Jack Reed, the committee's ranking member, noted that Hegseth had used the term \"jagoff\" in his book The War on Warriors (2024) to derogatorily refer to a Judge Advocate General officer who reprimanded him on the use of rocket-propelled grenades\n"

Hegseth revoked the security clearance and detail of Mark Milley, the former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and chief of staff of the Army who later became a critic of Trump, and ordered an inspector general inquiry into Milley's tenure as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff; the inspector general of the Department of Defense, Robert Storch, was removed from his position when Trump dismissed several inspectors general. According to The Washington Post, the Department of Defense Education Activity began removing certain books on immigration and sexuality.\n",
    "Hegseth visited the Mexico–United States border with Tom Homan, Trump's border czar, in El Paso, Texas, in February, where he stated that the federal government intended to gain complete \"operational control of the southern border\". He renamed Fort Liberty to Fort Bragg, its original name honoring the Confederate general Braxton Bragg. The military base was now ostensibly renamed for Roland L. Bragg, a previously obscure soldier who served in World War II. In a meeting before the Ukraine Defense Contact Group at NATO headquarters, he opposed NATO membership for Ukraine and said that returning Ukraine's borders prior to the annexation of Crimea by Russia was \"unrealistic\"\n"

The discussions involved US officials, including Vance and secretary of state Marco Rubio.

A spokesperson for the National Security Council confirmed Goldberg's report and the authenticity of the messages. Hegseth rejected that war plans were shared and called Goldberg \"deceitful\" and a \"discredited so-called journalist\".

The policy, which critics argued posed a threat to press freedom and First Amendment protections, was widely rejected by the media. Nearly all major US news organizations, including ABC, CNN, Fox News, The New York Times, and The Washington Post, refused to sign the agreement, citing concerns over press restrictions and government transparency. The only outlet to comply with the policy was One America News Network.\n"

    "On November 28, 2025, The Washington Post published an article alleging Hegseth had given a spoken order to kill the survivors of a September 2, 2025, strike led by SEAL Team 6 on a boat suspected of carrying drugs in the Caribbean Sea. The operation was overseen by Admiral Frank M. \"Mitch\" Bradley, from Fort Bragg in North Carolina. Bradley described the survivors as legitimate targets, as they could theoretically have contacted other traffickers to rescue them and their cargo, and subsequently ordered the second strike to complete Hegseth's order that everyone must be killed. The strike was the first in a series of strikes against suspected drug traffickers. Hegseth's alleged orders were characterized by legal experts as murder and a war crime. Todd Huntley, director of the national security law program at Georgetown Law, wrote that killing the passengers, even if the US were at war with the traffickers, \"would in essence be an order to show no quarter, which would be a war crime\". NYU Law professor Ryan Goodman wrote on X that the Post reporting described a \"textbook war crime/extrajudicial killing.\"\n",
    "The alleged orders were condemned by members of congress, including Representative Seth Moulton, who said \"Mark my words: It may take some time, but Americans will be prosecuted for this, either as a war crime or outright murder.\" Both Senators Tim Kaine and Mark Kelly described the alleged orders as a war crime\n"

In his book American Crusade (2020), Hegseth characterized \"Americanism\" as being opposition to movements such as feminism, globalism, Marxism, and progressivism, equated democracy to a leftist demand, and expressed support for election-rigging through gerrymandering to \"screw Democrats\". He described progressives and Democrats as enemies of freedom, the United States, and the Constitution. Hegseth has said that victory for America includes the end of globalism, socialism, secularism, environmentalism, Islamism, \"genderism\", and leftism. He has repeated false claims of electoral fraud in the 2020 presidential election and spread conspiracy theories about Antifa involvement in the January 6 attack.\n",
    "Hegseth initially supported Florida senator Marco Rubio in the 2016 Republican Party presidential primaries, later favored Texas senator Ted Cruz, and ultimately endorsed Donald Trump. He defended Trump's policies in his first term, including his interactions with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un, the 2020–2021 US troop withdrawal from Afghanistan, and the assassination of Qasem Soleimani\n"

    "In November 2024, Vanity Fair reported that Hegseth had allegedly sexually assaulted a woman at the Hyatt Regency Monterey Hotel and Spa on Del Monte Golf Course in Monterey, California, in October 2017, when he was scheduled to speak at the California Federation of Republican Women convention. According to the Monterey Police Department, Hegseth was investigated in connection with two incidents of sexual assault that occurred shortly before midnight and 7 a.m. the following morning. He was not criminally charged. The Washington Post reported that Hegseth had paid the accuser as part of a non-disclosure agreement after she threatened litigative action in 2020. In addition, the paper obtained a memorandum provided to Donald Trump's presidential transition team by an associate of the accuser, a 30-year-old conservative group staffer, that alleged that Hegseth raped her. Hegseth's lawyer, Timothy Parlatore, later confirmed the reports, but said that the staffer was attempting to extort Hegseth, a purported \"victim of blackmail and innocent collateral damage\", during the #MeToo movement, risking his career. The Associated Press reported in January 2025 that Hegseth had paid her US$50,000.\n",
    "Records released by the Monterey Police Department later that month provided additional details on the incident. The accuser told police that she had confronted Hegseth, who informed her that he was a \"nice guy\", after he had acted \"inappropriately\" with women at the event\n"

    ". She recalled being in an undisclosed room with Hegseth, who allegedly took her phone and blocked the door, where he then allegedly raped her. The accuser said that \"things got fuzzy\" and told a nurse days later that she had believed she had been drugged. Hegseth told police that he had sought to ensure she was comfortable. Video surveillance footage showed Hegseth and the accuser walking, with her smiling. Two women who were interviewed by police stated that Hegseth had put his hand on their thighs and asked them to go to his hotel room, with one woman saying that she had asked the accuser to get him off her. According to CNN, the accuser went to a hospital to report a sexual assault and obtained a rape kit test in the emergency room. The rape kit exam served as the impetus for the Monterey Police Department's investigation. Hegseth told police that he did have sex with the woman but that it was consensual. Monterey County district attorney Jeannine M. Pacioni declined to file charges in January 2018, saying that proof beyond a reasonable doubt was not established.\n"

    "In In the Arena (2016), Hegseth described his Christian faith as initially \"more out of diligent habit than deep conviction\". Following the September 11 attacks, he developed a hatred for Islamic terrorism, and \"he found himself repelled by the [Princeton University] campus chapel's 'gospel of moral relativism,' and disparaged his fellow students for focusing on peace and 'mutual understanding' rather than 'condemnations of Islamic terrorism'\". He told Nashville Christian Family that he experienced a religious transformation in 2018 after he and his wife, Jennifer, began attending the Colts Neck Community Church in New Jersey. Seeking to send their children to Jonathan Edwards Classical Academy, a Christian school, the Hegseths moved to Nashville, Tennessee, three years later. There, they joined the Pilgrim Hill Reformed Fellowship, a church in the Communion of Reformed Evangelical Churches (CREC). Hegseth is a supporter of CREC co-founder Douglas Wilson\n"

    "Hegseth has several tattoos, including one across his right biceps reading Deus vult, a Christian phrase associated with divine providence and God's will, as well as a tattoo of the Jerusalem cross on his right breast; the combination of Deus Vult and the cross has been associated with right-wing extremist groups. Hegseth also has a tattoo near the Deus vult tattoo reading kafir (transl. unbeliever) in Arabic, garnering criticism from some Muslims, who accused him of Islamophobia. In addition, he has a tattoo of the 1754 political cartoon Join, or Die, a cross and sword with Hebrew lettering reading Yeshua (ישוע), and the words \"We the People\" on his right forearm, as well as the coat of arms of the 187th Infantry Regiment on his back, including its motto Ne Desit Virtus or \"Let Valor Not Fail\". He also has a tattoo of the Christogram, which was the standard of the Christian Roman Empire and has been interpreted as an anti-pagan symbol. In 2024, Hegseth said that concerns over his Jerusalem cross tattoo caused the District of Columbia National Guard to pull him from a mission to guard the inauguration of President Joe Biden and helped spur him to retire from the military. According to the fact-checking website Snopes, at least two of Hegseth's tattoos depict symbols associated with Christian nationalism, though Hegseth may not adhere to Christian nationalist views himself.\n"
